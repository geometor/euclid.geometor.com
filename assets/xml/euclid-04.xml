      <p>Similarly it can be proved that the angles <emph>BAE</emph>, <emph>AED</emph> have also been bisected by the straight lines <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FE</emph> respectively. </p>
      <p>Now let <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> be drawn from the point <emph>F</emph> perpendicular to the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then, since the angle <emph>HCF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>KCF</emph>, and the right angle <emph>FHC</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>FKC</emph>, <emph>FHC</emph>, <emph>FKC</emph> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <emph>FC</emph> which is common to them and subtends one of the equal angles; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [<ref target="elem.1.26" targOrder="U">I. 26</ref>] therefore the perpendicular <emph>FH</emph> is equal to the perpendicular <emph>FK</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph>, <emph>FG</emph> is also equal to each of the straight lines <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>; <pb n="106" />therefore the five straight lines <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>F</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> will pass also through the remaining points; and it will touch the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph>, because the angles at the points <emph>G</emph>, <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph>, <emph>L</emph>, <emph>M</emph> are right. </p>
      <p>For, if it does not touch them. but cuts them, it will result that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity falls within the circle: which was proved absurd. [<ref target="elem.3.16" targOrder="U">III. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>F</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> will not cut the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore it will touch them.</hi>

      <p>Let the diameter <emph>AD</emph> of the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph> be drawn; let the centre <emph>G</emph> of the circle be taken, and with centre <emph>D</emph> and distance <emph>DG</emph> let the circle <emph>EGCH</emph> be described; <figure /> let <emph>EG</emph>, <emph>CG</emph> be joined and carried through to the points <emph>B</emph>, <emph>F</emph>, and let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>I say that the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equilateral and equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the point <emph>G</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>GE</emph> is equal to <emph>GD</emph>.</hi>
       <pb n="108" /></p>
      <p>Again, since the point <emph>D</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>GCH</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>DE</emph> is equal to <emph>DG</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>GE</emph> was proved equal to <emph>GD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>GE</emph> is also equal to <emph>ED</emph>; therefore the triangle <emph>EGD</emph> is equilateral;</hi> and therefore its three angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>GDE</emph>, <emph>DEG</emph> are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another. [<ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>EGD</emph> is one-third of two right angles.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, the angle <emph>DGC</emph> can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles. </p>
      <p>And, since the straight line <emph>CG</emph> standing on <emph>EB</emph> makes the adjacent angles <emph>EGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph> equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle <emph>CGB</emph> is also one-third of two right angles. </p>
      <p>Therefore the angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>DGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph> are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles <emph>BGA</emph>, <emph>AGF</emph>, <emph>FGE</emph> are equal. [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the six angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>DGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph>, <emph>BGA</emph>, <emph>AGF</emph>, <emph>FGE</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<ref target="elem.3.26" targOrder="U">III. 26</ref>] therefore the six circumferences <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<ref target="elem.3.29" targOrder="U">III. 29</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equilateral.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the circumference <emph>FA</emph> is equal to the circumference <emph>ED</emph>, <hi rend="center">let the circumference <emph>ABCD</emph> be added to each; therefore the whole <emph>FABCD</emph> is equal to the whole <emph>EDCBA</emph>;</hi>
       <pb n="109" />and the angle <emph>FED</emph> stands on the circumference <emph>FABCD</emph>, and the angle <emph>AFE</emph> on the circumference <emph>EDCBA</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>AFE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.27" targOrder="U">III. 27</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> are also severally equal to each of the angles <emph>AFE</emph>, <emph>FED</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equiangular.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But it was also proved equilateral; and it has been inscribed in the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph>. </p>

       <p>From this it is manifest that the side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle. </p>

      <p>In the circle <emph>ABCD</emph> let there be inscribed a side <emph>AC</emph> of the equilateral triangle inscribed in it, and a side <emph>AB</emph> of an equilateral pentagon; therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle <emph>ABCD</emph>, there will be five in the circumference <emph>ABC</emph> which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference <emph>AB</emph> which is one-fifth of the circle; <hi rend="center">therefore in the remainder <emph>BC</emph> there will be two of the equal segments.</hi>
