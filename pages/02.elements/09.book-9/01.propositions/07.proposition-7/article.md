       <hi rend="ital">If a composite number by multiplying any number make some number, the product will be solid.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a composite number by multiplying any number make some number, the product will be solid.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the composite number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying any number <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> is solid. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is composite, it will be measured by some number. [<a href="/elem.7.def.13">VII. Def. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be measured by <span class="ital">D</span>; and, as many times as <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">E</span>. <pb n="390"/></p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, and <span class="ital">A</span> is the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is solid, and <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are its sides. Q. E. D.</p>
