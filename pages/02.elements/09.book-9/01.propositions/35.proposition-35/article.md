<h1>PROPOSITION 35.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please be in continued proportion, and there be subtracted from the second and the last numbers equal to the first, then, as the excess of the second is to the first, so will the excess of the last be to all those before it.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, beginning from <span class="ital">A</span> as least, and let there be subtracted from <span class="ital">BC</span> and <span class="ital">EF</span> the numbers <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span>, each equal to <span class="ital">A</span>; I say that, as <span class="ital">GC</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">FK</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">FL</span> equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">FK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, and of these the part <span class="ital">FH</span> is equal to the part <span class="ital">BG</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to the remainder <span class="ital">GC</span>. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">EF</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">BC</span> to <span class="ital">A</span>, while <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FL</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> to <span class="ital">FK</span>, and <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">FH</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">EF</span> is to <span class="ital">FL</span>, so is <span class="ital">LF</span> to <span class="ital">FK</span>, and <span class="ital">FK</span> to <span class="ital">FH</span>. </p>

<p><foreign lang="la">Separando</foreign>, as <span class="ital">EL</span> is to <span class="ital">LF</span>, so is <span class="ital">LK</span> to <span class="ital">FK</span>, and <span class="ital">KH</span> to <span class="ital">FH</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.11 elem.7.13">VII. 11, 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<a href="/elem.7.12">VII. 12</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">KH</span> is to <span class="ital">FH</span>, so are <span class="ital">EL</span>, <span class="ital">LK</span>. <span class="ital">KH</span> to <span class="ital">LF</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> to <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">LF</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">CG</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the excess of the second is to the first, so is the excess of the last to all those before it. Q. E. D.<pb n="421"/></p>
