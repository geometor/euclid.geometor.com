===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the assigned prime numbers; I say that there are more prime numbers than <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the least number measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be taken, and let it be <span class="ital">DE</span>; let the unit <span class="ital">DF</span> be added to <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Then <span class="ital">EF</span> is either prime or not. </p>

<p>First, let it be prime; then the prime numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> have been found which are more than <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">EF</span> not be prime; therefore it is measured by some prime number. [<a href="/elem.7.31">VII. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be measured by the prime number <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">G</span> is not the same with any of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be so. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> also will measure <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">G</span>, being a number, will measure the remainder, the unit <span class="ital">DF</span>: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">G</span> is not the same with any one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>And by hypothesis it is prime. </p>

<p>Therefore the prime numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> have been found which are more than the assigned multitude of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>.
