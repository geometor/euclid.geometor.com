<h1>PROPOSITION 31.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If an odd number be prime to any number, it will also be prime to the double of it.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the odd number <span class="ital">A</span> be prime to any number <span class="ital">B</span>, and let <span class="ital">C</span> be double of <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is prime to <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if they are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. <pb n="418"/></p>

<p>Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">A</span> is odd; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also odd. </p>

<p>And since <span class="ital">D</span> which is odd measures <span class="ital">C</span>, and <span class="ital">C</span> is even, therefore [<span class="ital">D</span>] will measure the half of <span class="ital">C</span> also. [<a href="/elem.9.30">IX. 30</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">B</span> is half of <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> cannot but be prime to <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
