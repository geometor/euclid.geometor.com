       <hi rend="ital">If an odd number measure an even number, it will also measure the half of it.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If an odd number measure an even number, it will also measure the half of it.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the odd number <span class="ital">A</span> measure the even number <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that it will also measure the half of it. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, let it measure it according to <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> is not odd. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be so. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is made up of odd numbers the multitude of which is odd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is odd: [<a href="/elem.9.23">IX. 23</a>] which is absurd, for by hypothesis it is even. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is not odd; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is even. </p>

<p>Thus <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> an even number of times. </p>

<p>For this reason then it also measures the half of it. Q. E. D.</p>
