===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If from an odd number an odd number be subtracted, the remainder will be even.</span>
      </p>

<p>For from the odd number <span class="ital">AB</span> let the odd number <span class="ital">BC</span> be subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="ital">CA</span> is even. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is odd, let the unit <span class="ital">BD</span> be subtracted; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">AD</span> is even. [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">CD</span> is also even; [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] so that the remainder <span class="ital">CA</span> is also even. [<a href="/elem.9.24">IX. 24</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
