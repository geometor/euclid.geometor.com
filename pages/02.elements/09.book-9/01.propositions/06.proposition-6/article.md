<h1>PROPOSITION 6.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number by multiplying itself make a cube number, it will itself also be cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make the cube number <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is also cube. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Since, then, <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">B</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is cube. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in itself. </p>

<p>But the unit also measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But the unit also measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it. <pb n="389"/></p>

<p>Therefore, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are cube, they are similar solid numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.19">VIII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also. [<a href="/elem.8.8">VIII. 8</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">B</span> is cube; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is also cube. [cf. <a href="/elem.8.23">VIII. 23</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
