       <hi rend="ital">If an odd number by multiplying an even number make some number, the product will be even.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If an odd number by multiplying an even number make some number, the product will be even.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the odd number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying the even number <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> is even. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is made up of as many numbers equal to <span class="ital">B</span> as there are units in <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">B</span> is even; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is made up of even numbers. </p>

<p>But, if as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even. [<a href="/elem.9.21">IX. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is even. Q. E. D.</p>
