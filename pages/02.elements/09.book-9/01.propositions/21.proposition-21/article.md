===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let as many even numbers as we please, <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, be added together; I say that the whole <span class="ital">AE</span> is even. 
      </p>

<p>For, since each of the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is even, it has a half part; [<a href="/elem.7.def.6">VII. Def. 6</a>] so that the whole <span class="ital">AE</span> also has a half part. </p>

<p>But an even number is that which is divsible into two equal parts; [<span class="ital">id</span>.] therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is even. Q. E. D.</p>
