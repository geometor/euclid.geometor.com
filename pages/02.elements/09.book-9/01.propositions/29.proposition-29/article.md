<h1>PROPOSITION 29.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If an odd number by multiplying an odd number make some number, the product will be odd.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the odd number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying the odd number <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> is odd. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, <pb n="417"/>therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is made up of as many numbers equal to <span class="ital">B</span> as there are units in <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>And each of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is odd; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is made up of odd numbers the multitude of which is odd. </p>

<p>Thus <span class="ital">C</span> is odd. [<a href="/elem.9.23">IX. 23</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
