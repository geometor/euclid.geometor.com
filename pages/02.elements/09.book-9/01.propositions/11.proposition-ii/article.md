<h1>PROPOSITION II.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, the less measures the greater according to some one of the numbers which have place among the proportional numbers.</span>
       <pb n="396"/>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, beginning from the unit <span class="ital">A</span> and in continued proportion; I say that <span class="ital">B</span>, the least of the numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, measures <span class="ital">E</span> according to some one of the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For since, as the unit <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measures the number <span class="ital">B</span> the same number of times as <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore, alternately, the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> the same number of times as <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.15">VII. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to the units in it; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> also measures <span class="ital">E</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">D</span>; so that <span class="ital">B</span> the less measures <span class="ital">E</span> the greater according to some number of those which have place among the proportional numbers.— </p>

<p>And it is manifest that, whatever place the measuring number has, reckoned from the unit, the same place also has the number according to which it measures, reckoned from the number measured, in the direction of the number before it.—</p>
