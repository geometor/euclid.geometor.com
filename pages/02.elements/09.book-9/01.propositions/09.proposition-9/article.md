<h1>PROPOSITION 9.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, and the number after the unit be square, all the rest will also be square. And, if the number after the unit be cube, all the rest will also be cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, beginning from an unit and in continued proportion, and let <span class="ital">A</span>, the number after the unit, be square; I say that all the rest will also be square. 
      </p>

<p>Now it has been proved that <span class="ital">B</span>, the third from the unit, is square, as are also all those which leave out one; [<a href="/elem.9.8">IX. 8</a>] I say that all the rest are also square. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="ital">A</span> is square, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is also square. [<a href="/elem.8.22">VIII. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="ital">B</span> is square, <span class="ital">D</span> is also square. [<a href="/elem.8.22">VIII. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that all the rest are also square. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span> be cube; I say that all the rest are also cube. </p>

<p>Now it has been proved that <span class="ital">C</span>, the fourth from the unit, is cube, as also are all those which leave out two; [<a href="/elem.9.8">IX. 8</a>] I say that all the rest are also cube. </p>

<p>For, since, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore the unit measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times as <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But the unit measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in itself; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">B</span>. <pb n="393"/></p>

<p>And <span class="ital">A</span> is cube. </p>

<p>But, if a cube number by multiplying itself make some number, the product is cube. [<a href="/elem.9.3">IX. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is also cube. </p>

<p>And, since the four numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="ital">A</span> is cube, <span class="ital">D</span> also is cube. [<a href="/elem.8.23">VIII. 23</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">E</span> is also cube, and similarly all the rest are cube. Q. E. D.</p>
