       <hi rend="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, and the number after the unit be not square, neither will any other be square except the third from the unit and all those which leave out one. And, if the number after the unit be not cube, neither will any other be cube except the fourth from the unit and all those which leave out two.</hi>

       <span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, and the number after the unit be not square, neither will any other be square except the third from the unit and all those which leave out one. And, if the number after the unit be not cube, neither will any other be cube except the fourth from the unit and all those which leave out two.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, beginning from an unit and in continued proportion, and let <span class="ital">A</span>, the number after the unit, not be square; <pb n="394"/>I say that neither will any other be square except the third from the unit &lt;and those which leave out one&gt;. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">C</span> be square. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">B</span> is also square; [<a href="/elem.9.8">IX. 8</a>] [therefore <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number]. </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; [so that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers]. [<a href="/elem.8.26">VIII. 26</a>, converse] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">B</span> is square; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is also square: which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is not square. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the numbers square except the third from the unit and those which leave out one. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span> not be cube. </p>

<p>I say that neither will any other be cube except the fourth from the unit and those which leave out two. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">D</span> be cube. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">C</span> is also cube; for it is fourth from the unit. [<a href="/elem.9.8">IX. 8</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> also has to <span class="ital">C</span> the ratio which a cube has to a cube. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">C</span> is cube; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is also cube. [<a href="/elem.8.25">VIII. 25</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, and the unit measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in itself; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made the cube number <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But, if a number by multiplying itself make a cube number, it is also itself cube. [<a href="/elem.9.6">IX. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is also cube: which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is not cube. <pb n="395"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the numbers cube except the fourth from the unit and those which leave out two. Q. E. D.</p>
