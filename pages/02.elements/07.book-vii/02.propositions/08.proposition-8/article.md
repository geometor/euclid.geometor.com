<h1>PROPOSITION 8.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number be the same parts of a number that a number subtracted is of a number subtracted, the remainder will also be the same parts of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">AB</span> be the same parts of the number <span class="ital">CD</span> that <span class="ital">AE</span> subtracted is of <span class="ital">CF</span> subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="ital">EB</span> is also the same parts of the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> is of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">GH</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever parts <span class="ital">GH</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>, the same parts also is <span class="ital">AE</span> of <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">GH</span> be divded into the parts of <span class="ital">CD</span>, namely <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span>, and <span class="ital">AE</span> into the parts of <span class="ital">CF</span>, namely <span class="ital">AL</span>, <span class="ital">LE</span>; thus the multitude of <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">AL</span>, <span class="ital">LE</span>. <pb n="308"/></p>

<p>Now since, whatever part <span class="ital">GK</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="ital">AL</span> of <span class="ital">CF</span>, while. <span class="ital">CD</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">GK</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">AL</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">GM</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever part <span class="ital">GK</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="ital">GM</span> of <span class="ital">CF</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">MK</span> is the same part of the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="ital">GK</span> is of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.7">VII. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since, whatever part <span class="ital">KH</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="ital">EL</span> of <span class="ital">CF</span>, while <span class="ital">CD</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">EL</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">KN</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">EL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever part <span class="ital">KH</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="ital">KN</span> of <span class="ital">CF</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">NH</span> is the same part of the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="ital">KH</span> is of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.7">VII. 7</a>] </p>

<p>But the remainder <span class="ital">MK</span> was also proved to be the same part of the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="ital">GK</span> is of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore also the sum of <span class="ital">MK</span>, <span class="ital">NH</span> is the same parts of <span class="ital">DF</span> that the whole <span class="ital">HG</span> is of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But the sum of <span class="ital">MK</span>, <span class="ital">NH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EB</span>, and <span class="ital">HG</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BA</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">EB</span> is the same parts of the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> is of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>.
