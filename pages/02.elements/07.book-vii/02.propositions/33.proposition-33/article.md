<h1>PROPOSITION 33.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Given as many numbers as we please, to find the least of those which have the same ratio with them.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the given numbers, as many as we please; thus it is required to find the least of <lb n="5"/>those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are either prime to one another or not. 
      </p>

<p>Now, if <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime to one <lb n="10"/>another, they are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] </p>

<p>But, if not, let <span class="ital">D</span> the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be taken, [<a href="/elem.7.3">VII. 3</a>] <pb n="334"/>and, as many times as <span class="ital">D</span> measures the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>
       <lb n="15"/>respectively, so many units let there be in the numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> respectively. </p>

<p>Therefore the numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> measure the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> respectively according to the units in <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> the same number of <lb n="20"/>times; therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that they are the least that are in that ratio. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are not the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <lb n="25"/>there will be numbers less than <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> which are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let them be <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>; therefore <span class="ital">H</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that the numbers <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> measure the numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> respectively. <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>Now, as many times as <span class="ital">H</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">M</span>; therefore the numbers <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> also measure the numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> respectively according to the units in <span class="ital">M</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">H</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">M</span>, <lb n="35"/>therefore <span class="ital">M</span> also measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">M</span> also measures the numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> according to the units in the numbers <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> respectively; </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">M</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. <lb n="40"/></p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">H</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">M</span>, therefore <span class="ital">H</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">M</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason also <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the product of <lb n="45"/><span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">M</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span> is greater than <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore <span class="ital">M</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>And it measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>: <pb n="335"/><lb n="50"/>which is impossible, for by hypothesis <span class="ital">D</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore there cannot be any numbers less than <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> which are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are the least of those which have the <lb n="55"/>same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. Q. E. D.
