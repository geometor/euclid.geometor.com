<h1>PROPOSITION 25.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, the product of one of them into itself will be prime to the remaining one.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two numbers prime to one another, and let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">C</span>: I say that <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">D</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another, and <span class="ital">A</span> is equal to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are also prime to one another. 
      </p>

<p>Therefore each of the two numbers <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> is prime to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> will also be prime to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.24">VII. 24</a>] <pb n="327"/></p>

<p>But the number which is the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> is <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="1. the product of one of them into itself." class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The Greek, <foreign lang="greek">ὁ ἐκ τοῦ ἑνὸς αὐτῶν γενόμενος</foreign>, literally <quote>the number produced from the one of them,</quote>
 leaves <quote>multiplied into itself</quote>
 to be understood.</blockquote></p>
