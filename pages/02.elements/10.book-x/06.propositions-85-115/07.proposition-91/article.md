<h1>PROPOSITION 91.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a first apotome, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is an apotome</span>. </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">AB</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> and the first apotome <span class="ital">AD</span>; </p>

<p>I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is an apotome. <pb n="191"/></p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is a first apotome, let <span class="ital">DG</span> be its annex; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>And the whole <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> set out, and the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GD</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.1">X. Deff. III. 1</a>] if therefore there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">DG</span> and deficient by a square figure, it divdes it into commensurable parts. [<a href="/elem.10.17">X. 17</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">DG</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on <span class="ital">EG</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>And through the points <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> let <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">FI</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AF</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AG</span> is also commensurable in length with each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] <pb n="192"/></p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AC</span> is rational; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> is also rational, so that each of the rectangles <span class="ital">AI</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> is also rational. [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">DE</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is also commensurable in length with each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Now let the square <span class="ital">LM</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AI</span>, and let there be subtracted the square <span class="ital">NO</span> having a common angle with it, the angle <span class="ital">LPM</span>, and equal to <span class="ital">FK</span>; therefore the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are about the same diameter. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">PR</span> be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn. </p>

<p>Since then the rectangle contained by <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="ital">EG</span> to <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="ital">AI</span> to <span class="ital">EK</span>, and, as <span class="ital">EG</span> is to <span class="ital">FG</span>, so is <span class="ital">EK</span> to <span class="ital">KF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="ital">AI</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">MN</span> is also a mean proportional between <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, as was before proved, [<a href="/elem.10.53.l.1">Lemma after X. 53</a>] and <span class="ital">AI</span> is equal to the square <span class="ital">LM</span>, and <span class="ital">KF</span> to <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MN</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">EK</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DH</span>, and <span class="ital">MN</span> to <span class="ital">LO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DK</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="ital">UVW</span> and <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AK</span> is also equal to the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">ST</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">ST</span> is the square on <span class="ital">LN</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">LN</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LN</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AB</span>. <pb n="193"/></p>

<p>I say next that <span class="ital">LN</span> is an apotome. </p>

<p>For, since each of the rectangles <span class="ital">AI</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> is rational, and they are equal to <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, therefore each of the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, that is, the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> respectively, is also rational; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">DH</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="ital">LO</span>, therefore <span class="ital">LO</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">LO</span> is medial, while <span class="ital">NO</span> is rational, therefore <span class="ital">LO</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">LO</span> is to <span class="ital">NO</span>, so is <span class="ital">LP</span> to <span class="ital">PN</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">LP</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">PN</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">LN</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>And it is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is an apotome. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
