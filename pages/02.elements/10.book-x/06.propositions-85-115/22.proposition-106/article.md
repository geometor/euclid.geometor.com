<h1>PROPOSITION 106.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable with that which produces with a rational area a medial whole is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and <span class="ital">CD</span> commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BE</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [<a href="/elem.10.77">X. 77</a>] </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made. </p>

<p>Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing, that <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are in the same ratio as <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>; so that <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. <pb n="234"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [<a href="/elem.10.77">X. 77</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
