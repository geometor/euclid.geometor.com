<h1>PROPOSITION 56.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the third binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">ABCD</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and the third binomial <span class="ital">AD</span> divded into its terms at <span class="ital">E</span>, of which terms <span class="ital">AE</span> is the greater; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial. </p>

<p>For let the same construction be made as before. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is a third binomial straight line, therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, and neither of the terms <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.3">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we shall prove that <span class="ital">MO</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC</span>, and <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; so that <span class="ital">MO</span> is bimedial. </p>

<p>It is next to be proved that it is also a second bimedial straight line. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">DE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>, that is, with <span class="ital">EK</span>, and <span class="ital">DE</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And they are rational; <pb n="125"/>therefore <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MR</span>, is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And it is contained by <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> is medial. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is a second bimedial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.38">X. 38</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
