<h1>PROPOSITION 79</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To an apotome only one rational straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be an apotome, and <span class="ital">BC</span> an annex to it; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] 
      </p>

<p>I say that no other rational straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which is commensurable with the whole in square only. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">BD</span> be so annexed; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, for both exceed by the same, the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] <pb n="168"/>therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is the excess of twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> exceed the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area, for both are rational; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> also exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area: which is impossible, for both are medial [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>], and a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [<a href="/elem.10.26">X. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no other rational straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which is commensurable with the whole in square only. </p>

<p>Therefore only one rational straight line can be annexed to an apotome which is commensurable with the whole in square only. Q. E. D.</p>
