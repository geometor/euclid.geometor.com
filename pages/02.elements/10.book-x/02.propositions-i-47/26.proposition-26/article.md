<h1>PROPOSITION 26.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">4 medial area does not exceed a medial area by a rational area</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let the medial area <span class="ital">AB</span> exceed the medial area <span class="ital">AC</span> by the rational area <span class="ital">DB</span>,  and let a rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out; to <span class="ital">EF</span> let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram <span class="ital">FH</span> equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="ital">EH</span> as breadth, and let the rectangle <span class="ital">FG</span> equal to <span class="ital">AC</span> be subtracted; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">BD</span> is equal to the remainder <span class="ital">KH</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DB</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Since, then, each of the rectangles <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> is medial, and <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FH</span>, and <span class="ital">AC</span> to <span class="ital">FG</span>, therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And they are applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">HE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since [<span class="ital">DB</span> is rational and is equal to <span class="ital">KH</span>, therefore] <span class="ital">KH</span> is [also] rational; and it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>; <pb n="59"/>therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EG</span> is also rational, and is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">EG</span> is to <span class="ital">GH</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EG</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">EG</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> are commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">EG</span>, for both are rational; and twice the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, for it is double of it; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] therefore also the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> and twice the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">EH</span> [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>], is incommensurable with the squares on <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> are rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">EH</span> is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>But it is also rational: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
