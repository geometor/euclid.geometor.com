<h1>PROPOSITION 25.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">The rectangle contained by medial straight lines commensurable in square only is either rational or medial</span>. </p>

<p>For let the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span> be contained by the medial straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> which are commensurable in square only; I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is either rational or medial. 
      </p>

<p>For on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> let the squares <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> be described; therefore each of the squares <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> is medial. </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> be set out, to <span class="ital">FG</span> let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram <span class="ital">GH</span> equal to <span class="ital">AD</span>, producing <span class="ital">FH</span> as breadth, to <span class="ital">HM</span> let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram <span class="ital">MK</span> equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, producing <span class="ital">HK</span> as breadth, and further to <span class="ital">KN</span> let there be similarly applied <span class="ital">NL</span> equal to <span class="ital">BE</span>, producing <span class="ital">KL</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> are in a straight line. </p>

<p>Since then each of the squares <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> is medial, and <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">GH</span>, and <span class="ital">BE</span> to <span class="ital">NL</span>, therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">NL</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And they are applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">BE</span>, therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">NL</span>. </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">GH</span> is to <span class="ital">NL</span>, so is <span class="ital">FH</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">KL</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] <pb n="57"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in length; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">DB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BA</span>, and <span class="ital">OB</span> to <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">BO</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is <span class="ital">DA</span> to <span class="ital">AC</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BO</span>, so is <span class="ital">AC</span> to <span class="ital">CO</span>; [<span class="ital">id</span>.] therefore, as <span class="ital">DA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is <span class="ital">AC</span> to <span class="ital">CO</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> to <span class="ital">MK</span> and <span class="ital">CO</span> to <span class="ital">NL</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">GH</span> is to <span class="ital">MK</span>, so is <span class="ital">MK</span> to <span class="ital">NL</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">FH</span> is to <span class="ital">HK</span>, so is <span class="ital">HK</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">HK</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is rational. </p>

<p>And, if it is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">HN</span> is rational; [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] but, if it is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">HM</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and therefore <span class="ital">HN</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">HN</span> is either rational or medial. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">HN</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is either rational or medial. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
