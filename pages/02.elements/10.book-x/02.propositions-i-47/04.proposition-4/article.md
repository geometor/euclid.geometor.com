<h1>PROPOSITION 4.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">Given three commensurable magnitudes</span>, <span class="ital">to find their greatest common measure</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the three given commensurable magnitudes; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let the greatest common measure of the two magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be taken, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.3">X. 3</a>] then <span class="ital">D</span> either measures <span class="ital">C</span>, or does not measure it. </p>

<p>First, let it measure it. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>, while it also measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude <span class="ital">D</span> does not measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">D</span> not measure <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>I say first that <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are commensurable. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them, and this will of course measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also; so that it will also measure the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, namely <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.3.p.1">X. 3, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">C</span>; so that the said magnitude will measure <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are commensurable. <pb n="23"/></p>

<p>Now let their greatest common measure be taken, and let it be <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.3">X. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, while <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">C</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let there be some magnitude <span class="ital">F</span> greater than <span class="ital">E</span>, and let it measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, it will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, and will measure the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.3.p.1">X. 3, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">C</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> will also measure the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.3.p.1">X. 3, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But that is <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> will measure <span class="ital">E</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no magnitude greater than the magnitude <span class="ital">E</span> will measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> if <span class="ital">D</span> do not measure <span class="ital">C</span>, and, if it measure it, <span class="ital">D</span> is itself the greatest common measure. </p>

<p>Therefore the greatest common measure of the three given commensurable magnitudes has been found. </p>

<p>From this it is manifest that, if a magnitude measure three magnitudes, it will also measure their greatest common measure. </p>

       
<p>Similarly too, with more magnitudes, the greatest common measure can be found, and the porism can be extended. Q. E. D.</p>
