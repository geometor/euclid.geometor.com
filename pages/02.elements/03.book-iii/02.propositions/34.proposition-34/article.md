<p><emph>From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle</emph>. </p>

<h1>PROPOSITION 34.</h1>
<p><em>From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given circle, and the angle at <em>D</em> the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to cut off from the circle <em>ABC</em> a segment admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>EF</em> be drawn touching <em>ABC</em> at the point <em>B</em>, and on the straight line <em>FB</em>, and at the point <em>B</em> on it, let the angle <em>FBC</em> be constructed equal to the angle at <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since a straight line <em>EF</em> touches the circle <em>ABC</em>, <pb n="71"/><span class="center">and <em>BC</em> has been drawn across from the point of contact at <em>B</em>,</span> the angle <em>FBC</em> is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment <em>BAC</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.32">III. 32</a>] 
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>FBC</em> is equal to the angle at <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle in the segment <em>BAC</em> is equal to the angle at <em>D</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore from the given circle <em>ABC</em> the segment <em>BAC</em>. has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at <em>D</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
