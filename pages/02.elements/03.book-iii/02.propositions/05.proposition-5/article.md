<p><emph>If two circles cut one another</emph>, <emph>they will not have the same centre</emph>. </p>

<h1>PROPOSITION 5.</h1>
<p><em>If two circles cut one another</em>, <em>they will not have the same centre</em>. </p>

<p>For let the circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>CDG</em> cut one another at the points <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>; I say that they will not have the same centre. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be <em>E</em>; let <em>EC</em> be joined, and let <em>EFG</em> be drawn through at random. </p>

<p>Then, since the point <em>E</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>, <span class="center"><em>EC</em> is equal to <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.def.15">I. Def. 15</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since the point <em>E</em> is the centre of the circle <em>CDG</em>, <span class="center"><em>EC</em> is equal to <em>EG</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>EC</em> was proved equal to <em>EF</em> also; <span class="center">therefore <em>EF</em> is also equal to <em>EG</em>, the less to the greater : which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the point <em>E</em> is not the centre of the circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>CDG</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
