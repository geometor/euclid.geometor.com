<h1>PROPOSITION 3.</h1>
<p><em>If in a circle a straight line through the centre bisect a straight line not through the centre</em>, <em>it also cuts it at right angles; and if it cut it at right angles</em>, <em>it also bisects it</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a circle, and in it let a straight line <em>CD</em>
       <lb n="5"/>through the centre bisect a straight line <em>AB</em> not through the centre at the point <em>F</em>;  I say that it also cuts it at right angles. </p>

<p>For let the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>
       <lb n="10"/>be taken, and let it be <em>E</em>; let <em>EA</em>, <em>EB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>, and <em>FE</em> is common, <span class="center">two sides are equal to two sides;</span>
       <lb n="15"/><span class="center">and the base <em>EA</em> is equal to the base <em>EB</em>; therefore the angle <em>AFE</em> is equal to the angle <em>BFE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">I. Def. 10</a>] <lb n="20"/><span class="center">therefore each of the angles <em>AFE</em>, <em>BFE</em> is right.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>CD</em>, which is through the centre, and bisects <em>AB</em> which is not through the centre, also cuts it at right angles. </p>

<p>Again, let <em>CD</em> cut <em>AB</em> at right angles; <lb n="25"/>I say that it also bisects it. that is, that <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>. <pb n="11"/></p>

<p>For, with the same construction, <span class="center">since <em>EA</em> is equal to <em>EB</em>,</span> the angle <em>EAF</em> is also equal to the angle <em>EBF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But the right angle <em>AFE</em> is equal to the right angle <em>BFE</em>, <lb n="30"/>therefore <em>EAF</em>, <em>EBF</em> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <em>EF</em>, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal angles; <span class="center">therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to <lb n="35"/>the remaining sides; [<a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] therefore <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="26" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
        
<p>with the same construction, <foreign lang="greek">τῶν αὐτῶν κατασκευασθέντων</foreign>.</p>

       </blockquote></p>
