<h1>PROPOSITION 28.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If a parallelepipedal solid be cut by a plane through the diagonals of the opposite planes</span>, <span class="ital">the solid will be bisected by the plane.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">AB</span> be cut by the plane <span class="ital">CDEF</span> through the diagonals <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> of opposite planes; I say that the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> will be bisected by the plane <span class="ital">CDEF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since the triangle <span class="ital">CGF</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="ital">CFB</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] and <span class="ital">ADE</span> to <span class="ital">DEH</span>, while the parallelogram <span class="ital">CA</span> is also equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">EB</span>, for they are opposite, and <span class="ital">GE</span> to <span class="ital">CH</span>, therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="ital">CGF</span>, <span class="ital">ADE</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="ital">GE</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span> is also equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="ital">CFB</span>, <span class="ital">DEH</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="ital">CH</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span>; <pb n="331"/>for they are contained by planes equal both in multitude and in magnitude. [<a href="/elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</a>] </p>

<p>Hence the whole solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is bisected by the plane <span class="ital">CDEF</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
