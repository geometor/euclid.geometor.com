<h1>PROPOSITION 8.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines be parallel</span>, <span class="ital">and one of them be at right angles to any plane</span>, <span class="ital">the remaining one will also be at right angles to the same plane.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be two parallel straight lines, and let one of them, <span class="ital">AB</span>, be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that the remaining one, <span class="ital">CD</span>, will also be at right angles to the same plane. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> meet the plane of reference at the points <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">BD</span> be joined; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> are in one plane. [<a href="/elem.11.7">XI. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">DE</span> be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to <span class="ital">BD</span>, let <span class="ital">DE</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore each of the angles <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">ABE</span> is right. </p>

<p>And, since the straight line <span class="ital">BD</span> has fallen on the parallels <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <pb n="288"/>therefore the angles <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">CDB</span> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="ital">CDB</span> is also right; therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is at right angles to <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>, and <span class="ital">BD</span> is common, the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>; and the angle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDB</span>, for each is right; therefore the base <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>, and <span class="ital">BE</span> to <span class="ital">AD</span>, the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span> respectively, and <span class="ital">AE</span> is their common base; therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDA</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="ital">EDA</span> is also right; therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> is at right angles to <span class="ital">AD</span>. </p>

<p>But it is also at right angles to <span class="ital">DB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.4">XI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DC</span> is in the plane through <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>, inasmuch as <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> are in the plane through <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.2">XI. 2</a>] and <span class="ital">DC</span> is also in the plane in which <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> are. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> is at right angles to <span class="ital">DC</span>, so that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is set up at right angles to the two straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> which cut one another, from the point of section at <span class="ital">D</span>; <pb n="289"/>so that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.4">XI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is the plane of reference; therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
