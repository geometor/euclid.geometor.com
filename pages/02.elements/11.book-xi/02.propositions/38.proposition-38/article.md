<h1>PROPOSITION 38.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If the sides of the opposite planes of a cube be bisected</span>, <span class="ital">and planes be carried through the points of section</span>, <span class="ital">the common section of the planes and the diameter of the cube bisect one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the sides of the opposite planes <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">AH</span> of the cube <span class="ital">AF</span> be bisected at the points <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">R</span>, <pb n="361"/>and through the points of section let the planes <span class="ital">KN</span>, <span class="ital">OR</span> be carried; let <span class="ital">US</span> be the common section of the planes, and <span class="ital">DG</span> the diameter of the cube <span class="ital">AF</span>. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">UT</span> is equal to <span class="ital">TS</span>, and <span class="ital">DT</span> to <span class="ital">TG</span>. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">DU</span>, <span class="ital">UE</span>, <span class="ital">BS</span>, <span class="ital">SG</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">DO</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">PE</span>, the alternate angles <span class="ital">DOU</span>, <span class="ital">UPE</span> are equal to one another. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">DO</span> is equal to <span class="ital">PE</span>, and <span class="ital">OU</span> to <span class="ital">UP</span>, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">DU</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">UE</span>, the triangle <span class="ital">DOU</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="ital">PUE</span>, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles; [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">OUD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">PUE</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For this reason <span class="ital">DUE</span> is a straight line. [<a href="/elem.1.14">I. 14</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason, <span class="ital">BSG</span> is also a straight line, and <span class="ital">BS</span> is equal to <span class="ital">SG</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">CA</span> is equal and parallel to <span class="ital">DB</span>, while <span class="ital">CA</span> is also equal and parallel to <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DB</span> is also equal and parallel to <span class="ital">EG</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.9">XI. 9</a>] <pb n="362"/></p>

<p>And the straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">BG</span> join their extremities; therefore <span class="ital">DE</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">BG</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">EDT</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">BGT</span>, for they are alternate; [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] and the angle <span class="ital">DTU</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">GTS</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.15">I. 15</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DTU</span>, <span class="ital">GTS</span> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending one of the equal angles, that is, <span class="ital">DU</span> equal to <span class="ital">GS</span>, for they are the halves of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">BG</span>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [<a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DT</span> is equal to <span class="ital">TG</span>, and <span class="ital">UT</span> to <span class="ital">TS</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
