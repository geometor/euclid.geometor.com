<h1>PROPOSITION 19.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two planes which cut one another be at right angles to any plane</span>, <span class="ital">their common section will also be at right angles to the same plane.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be at right angles to the plane of reference, and let <span class="ital">BD</span> be their common section; I say that <span class="ital">BD</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>For suppose it is not, and from the point <span class="ital">D</span> let <span class="ital">DE</span> be drawn in the plane <span class="ital">AB</span> at right angles to the straight line <span class="ital">AD</span>, and <span class="ital">DF</span> in the plane <span class="ital">BC</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since the plane <span class="ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, and <span class="ital">DE</span> has been drawn in the plane <span class="ital">AB</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">AD</span>, their common section, therefore <span class="ital">DE</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. [<a href="/elem.11.def.4">XI. Def. 4</a>] <pb n="305"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">DF</span> is also at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Therefore from the same point <span class="ital">D</span> two straight lines have been set up at right angles to the plane of reference on the same side: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.11.13">XI. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no straight line except the common section <span class="ital">DB</span> of the planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> can be set up from the point <span class="ital">D</span> at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
