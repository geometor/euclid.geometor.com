<h1>PROPOSITION 22.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If there be three plane angles of which two</span>, <span class="ital">taken together in any manner</span>, <span class="ital">are greater than the remaining one</span>, <span class="ital">and they are contained by equal straight lines</span>, <span class="ital">it is possible to construct a triangle out of the straight lines joining the extremities of the equal straight lines.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be three plane angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span>, of <pb n="313"/>which two, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one, namely <span class="center">the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span> greater than the angle <span class="ital">GHK</span>, the angles <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> greater than the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span>,</span> and, further, the angles <span class="ital">GHK</span>, <span class="ital">ABC</span> greater than the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>; let the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> be equal, and let <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> be joined; I say that it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>, that is, that any two of the straight lines <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> are greater than the remaining one. 
      </p>

<p>Now, if the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> are equal to one another, it is manifest that, <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> being equal also, it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. </p>

<p>But, if not, let them be unequal, and on the straight line <span class="ital">HK</span>, and at the point <span class="ital">H</span> on it, let the angle <span class="ital">KHL</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span>; let <span class="ital">HL</span> be made equal to one of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, and let <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">GL</span> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">HL</span>, and the angle at <span class="ital">B</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KHL</span>, therefore the base <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">KL</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> are greater than the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <pb n="314"/>while the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KHL</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">GHL</span> is greater than the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HL</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">GHL</span> is greater than the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>, therefore the base <span class="ital">GL</span> is greater than the base <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.24">I. 24</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> are greater than <span class="ital">GL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> are much greater than <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> are greater than the remaining straight line <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> are greater than <span class="ital">GK</span>, and further <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> are greater than <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
