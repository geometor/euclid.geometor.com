<h1>PROPOSITION 13.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To construct a pyramid</span>, <span class="ital">to comprehend it in a given sphere</span>, <span class="ital">and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid.</span>
       <pb n="468"/></p>

<p>Let the diameter <span class="ital">AB</span> of the given sphere be set out, and let it be cut at the point <span class="ital">C</span> so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CB</span>; let the semicircle <span class="ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">CD</span> be drawn from the point <span class="ital">C</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">DA</span> be joined; let the circle <span class="ital">EFG</span> which has its radius equal to <span class="ital">DC</span> be set out, let the equilateral triangle <span class="ital">EFG</span> be inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">EFG</span>, [<a href="/elem.4.2">IV. 2</a>] let the centre of the circle, the point <span class="ital">H</span>, be taken, [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>] let <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> be joined; from the point <span class="ital">H</span> let <span class="ital">HK</span> be set up at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">EFG</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.12">XI. 12</a>] let <span class="ital">HK</span> equal to the straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> be cut off from <span class="ital">HK</span>, and let <span class="ital">KE</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">KG</span> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">KH</span> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">EFG</span>, therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of the circle <span class="ital">EFG</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But each of the straight lines <span class="ital">HE</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> meets it: therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">HE</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">HK</span>, and <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">HE</span>, and they contain right angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">DA</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">KE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] <pb n="469"/></p>

<p>For the same reason each of the straight lines <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">KG</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">DA</span>; therefore the three straight lines <span class="ital">KE</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">KG</span> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, as will be proved afterwards. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">FE</span> is also triple of the square on <span class="ital">EH</span>, [<a href="/elem.13.12">XIII. 12</a>] and <span class="ital">DC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EH</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DA</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DA</span> was proved equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">KE</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">KG</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> is also equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">KE</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">KG</span>; therefore the four triangles <span class="ital">EFG</span>, <span class="ital">KEF</span>, <span class="ital">KFG</span>, <span class="ital">KEG</span> are equilateral. </p>

<p>Therefore a pyramid has been constructed out of four equilateral triangles, the triangle <span class="ital">EFG</span> being its base and the point <span class="ital">K</span> its vertex. </p>

<p>It is next required to comprehend it in the given sphere and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid. </p>

<p>For let the straight line <span class="ital">HL</span> be produced in a straight line with <span class="ital">KH</span>, and let <span class="ital">HL</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since, as <span class="ital">AC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">CB</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.8.p.1">VI. 8, Por.</a>] while <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">HE</span>, and <span class="ital">CB</span> to <span class="ital">HL</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">KH</span> is to <span class="ital">HE</span>, so is <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">HL</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">HL</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EH</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And each of the angles <span class="ital">KHE</span>. <span class="ital">EHL</span> is right; therefore the semicircle described on <span class="ital">KL</span> will pass through <span class="ital">E</span> also. [cf. <a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>, <a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>.] <pb n="470"/></p>

<p>If then, <span class="ital">KL</span> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through the points <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, since, if <span class="ital">FL</span>, <span class="ital">LG</span> be joined, the angles at <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> similarly become right angles; and the pyramid will be comprehended in the given sphere. </p>

<p>For <span class="ital">KL</span>, the diameter of the sphere, is equal to the diameter <span class="ital">AB</span> of the given sphere, inasmuch as <span class="ital">KH</span> was made equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, and <span class="ital">HL</span> to <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of <span class="ital">BC</span>; and, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, <span class="ital">BA</span> is one and a half times <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is also one and a half times the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">BA</span> is the diameter of the given sphere, and <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to the side of the pyramid. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid. Q. E. D.</p>
<div id="elem.13.13.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>It is to be proved that, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

       
<p>For let the figure of the semicircle be set out, let <span class="ital">DB</span> be joined, let the square <span class="ital">EC</span> be described on <span class="ital">AC</span>, and let the parallelogram <span class="ital">FB</span> be completed. 
       </p>

       
<p>Since then, because the triangle <span class="ital">DAB</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">DAC</span>, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AD</span>, so is <span class="ital">DA</span> to <span class="ital">AC</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>, <a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] <pb n="471"/>therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

       
<p>And since, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is <span class="ital">EB</span> to <span class="ital">BF</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and <span class="ital">EB</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, for <span class="ital">EA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, and <span class="ital">BF</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

       
<p>And the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, for the perpendicular <span class="ital">DC</span> is a mean proportional between the segments <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> of the base, because the angle <span class="ital">ADB</span> is right. [<a href="/elem.6.8.p.1">VI. 8, Por.</a>] </p>

       
<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
