<h1>PROPOSITION 6.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If a rational straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">each of the segments is the irrational straight line called apotome.</span>
       <pb n="450"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a rational straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">C</span>, and let <span class="ital">AC</span> be the greater segment; I say that each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is the irrational straight line called apotome. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BA</span> be produced, and let <span class="ital">AD</span> be made half of <span class="ital">BA</span>. </p>

<p>Since then the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and to the greater segment <span class="ital">AC</span> is added <span class="ital">AD</span> which is half of <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">DA</span>. [<a href="/elem.13.1">XIII. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">DA</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">DA</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">DA</span> is rational, for <span class="ital">DA</span> is rational, being half of <span class="ital">AB</span> which is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is also rational; [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> has not to the square on <span class="ital">DA</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DA</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <span class="ital">AC</span> is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.3">VI. Def. 3</a>, <a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the square on the apotome <span class="ital">AC</span>, if applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span>, produces <span class="ital">BC</span> as breadth. </p>

<p>But the square on an apotome, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a first apotome; [<a href="/elem.10.97">X. 97</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CB</span> is a first apotome. <pb n="451"/></p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CA</span> was also proved to be an apotome. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
