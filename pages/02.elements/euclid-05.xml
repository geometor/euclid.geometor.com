 In a number of expressions like this it is absolutely necessary, when translating into English, to interpolate words which are not in the Greek. Thus the Greek here is: <foreign lang="greek">Ἕστω τέσσαρα μεγέθη ἀνάλογον τὰ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, ὡς τὸ Α πρὸς τὸ Β, οὕτως τὸ Γ πρὸς τὸ Δ</foreign>, literally <quote>Let <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>, <emph>C</emph>, <emph>D</emph> be four proportional magnitudes, as <emph>A</emph> to <emph>B</emph>, so <emph>C</emph> to <emph>D</emph>.</quote>
 The same remark applies to the corresponding expressions in the next propositions, <ref target="elem.5.17 elem.5.18" targOrder="U">V. 17, 18</ref>, and to other forms of expression in <ref target="elem.5.20 elem.5.21 elem.5.22 elem.5.23" targOrder="U">V. 20-23</ref> and later propositions: e.g. in <ref target="elem.5.20" targOrder="U">V. 20</ref> we have a phrase meaning literally <quote>Let there be magnitudes...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, as <emph>A</emph> to <emph>B</emph>, so <emph>D</emph> to <emph>E</emph>,</quote>
