       <hi rend="ital">Parallelepipedal solids which are of the same height are to one another as their bases.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Parallelepipedal solids which are of the same height are to one another as their bases.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be parallelepipedal solids of the same height; I say that the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are to one another as their bases, that is, that, as the base <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">FH</span> equal to <span class="ital">AE</span> be applied to <span class="ital">FG</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.45">I. 45</a>] and on <span class="ital">FH</span> as base, and with the same height as that of <span class="ital">CD</span>, let the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">GK</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Then the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">GK</span>; for they are on equal bases <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> and of the same height. [<a href="/elem.11.31">XI. 31</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">CK</span> is cut by the plane <span class="ital">DG</span> which is parallel to opposite planes, therefore, as the base <span class="ital">CF</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the solid <span class="ital">DH</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] </p>

<p>But the base <span class="ital">FH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">AE</span>, and the solid <span class="ital">GK</span> to the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore also, as the base <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
