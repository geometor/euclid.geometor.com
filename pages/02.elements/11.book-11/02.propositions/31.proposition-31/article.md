<h1>PROPOSITION 31.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">CF</span>, of the same height, be on equal bases <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>I say that the solid <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>First, let the sides which stand up, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">PQ</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">CO</span>, <span class="ital">RS</span>, be at right angles to the bases <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; let the straight line <span class="ital">RT</span> be produced in a straight line with <span class="ital">CR</span>; on the straight line <span class="ital">RT</span>, and at the point <span class="ital">R</span> on it, let the angle <span class="ital">TRU</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="ital">ALB</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] let <span class="ital">RT</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AL</span>, and <span class="ital">RU</span> equal to <span class="ital">LB</span>, and let the base <span class="ital">RW</span> and the solid <span class="ital">XU</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Now, since the two sides <span class="ital">TR</span>, <span class="ital">RU</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">AL</span>, <span class="ital">LB</span>, and they contain equal angles, therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">RW</span> is equal and similar to the parallelogram <span class="ital">HL</span>. </p>

<p>Since again <span class="ital">AL</span> is equal to <span class="ital">RT</span>, and <span class="ital">LM</span> to <span class="ital">RS</span>, and they contain right angles, <pb n="338"/>therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">RX</span> is equal and similar to the parallelogram <span class="ital">AM</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">LE</span> is also equal and similar to <span class="ital">SU</span>; therefore three parallelograms of the solid <span class="ital">AE</span> are equal and similar to three parallelograms of the solid <span class="ital">XU</span>. </p>

<p>But the former three are equal and similar to the three opposite, and the latter three to the three opposite; [<a href="/elem.11.24">XI. 24</a>] therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to the whole parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">XU</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">DR</span>, <span class="ital">WU</span> be drawn through and meet one another at <span class="ital">Y</span>, let <span class="ital">aTb</span> be drawn through <span class="ital">T</span> parallel to <span class="ital">DY</span>, let <span class="ital">PD</span> be produced to <span class="ital">a</span>, and let the solids <span class="ital">YX</span>, <span class="ital">RI</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Then the solid <span class="ital">XY</span>, of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">RX</span> is the base and <span class="ital">Yc</span> its opposite, is equal to the solid <span class="ital">XU</span> of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">RX</span> is the base and <span class="ital">UV</span> its opposite, for they are on the same base <span class="ital">RX</span> and of the same height, and the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely <span class="ital">RY</span>, <span class="ital">RU</span>, <span class="ital">Tb</span>, <span class="ital">TW</span>, <span class="ital">Se</span>, <span class="ital">Sd</span>, <span class="ital">Xc</span>, <span class="ital">XV</span>, are on the same straight lines <span class="ital">YW</span>, <span class="ital">eV</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.29">XI. 29</a>] </p>

<p>But the solid <span class="ital">XU</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AE</span>: therefore the solid <span class="ital">XY</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">AE</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the parallelogram <span class="ital">RUWT</span> is equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">YT</span> for they are on the same base <span class="ital">RT</span> and in the same parallels <span class="ital">RT</span>, <span class="ital">YW</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.35">I. 35</a>] while <span class="ital">RUWT</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CD</span>, since it is also equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">YT</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DT</span> is another parallelogram; therefore, as the base <span class="ital">CD</span> is to <span class="ital">DT</span>, so is <span class="ital">YT</span> to <span class="ital">DT</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">CI</span> has been cut by the plane <span class="ital">RF</span> which is parallel to opposite planes, as the base <span class="ital">CD</span> is to the base <span class="ital">DT</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">CF</span> to the solid <span class="ital">RI</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] <pb n="339"/></p>

<p>For the same reason, since the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">YI</span> has been cut by the plane <span class="ital">RX</span> which is parallel to opposite planes, as the base <span class="ital">YT</span> is to the base <span class="ital">TD</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">YX</span> to the solid <span class="ital">RI</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the base <span class="ital">CD</span> is to <span class="ital">DT</span>, so is <span class="ital">YT</span> to <span class="ital">DT</span>; therefore also, as the solid <span class="ital">CF</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">RI</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">YX</span> to <span class="ital">RI</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore each of the solids <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">YX</span> has to <span class="ital">RI</span> the same ratio; therefore the solid <span class="ital">CF</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">YX</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">YX</span> was proved equal to <span class="ital">AE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let the sides standing up, <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">CN</span>, <span class="ital">PQ</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">RS</span>, not be at right angles to the bases <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; I say again that the solid <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For from the points <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">S</span> let <span class="ital">KO</span>, <span class="ital">ET</span>, <span class="ital">GU</span>, <span class="ital">MV</span>, <span class="ital">QW</span>, <span class="ital">FX</span>, <span class="ital">NY</span>, <span class="ital">SI</span> be drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference, and let them meet the plane at the points <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">T</span>, <span class="ital">U</span>, <span class="ital">V</span>, <span class="ital">W</span>, <span class="ital">X</span>, <span class="ital">Y</span>, <span class="ital">I</span>, and let <span class="ital">OT</span>, <span class="ital">OU</span>, <span class="ital">UV</span>, <span class="ital">TV</span>, <span class="ital">WX</span>, <span class="ital">WY</span>, <span class="ital">YI</span>, <span class="ital">IX</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then the solid <span class="ital">KV</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">QI</span>, for they are on the equal bases <span class="ital">KM</span>, <span class="ital">QS</span> and of the same height, and their sides which stand up are at right angles to their bases. [First part of this Prop.] </p>

<p>But the solid <span class="ital">KV</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">AE</span>, and <span class="ital">QI</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>; for they are on the same base and of the same height, while the extremities of their sides which stand up are not on the same straight lines. [<a href="/elem.11.30">XI. 30</a>] <pb n="340"/></p>

<p>Therefore the solid <span class="ital">AE</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
