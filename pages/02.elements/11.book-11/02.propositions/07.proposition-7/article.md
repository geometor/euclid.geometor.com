<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines be parallel and points be taken at random on each of them</span>, <span class="ital">the straight line joining the points is in the same plane with the parallel straight lines.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be two parallel straight lines, and let points <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> be taken at random on them respectively; I say that the straight line joining the points <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> is in the same plane with the parallel straight lines. 
      </p>

<p>For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let it be in a more elevated plane as <span class="ital">EGF</span>, and let a plane be drawn through <span class="ital">EGF</span>; it will then make, as section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<a href="/elem.11.3">XI. 3</a>] <pb n="286"/></p>

<p>Let it make it, as <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore the two straight lines <span class="ital">EGF</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> will enclose an area: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line joined from <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span> is not in a plane more elevated; therefore the straight line joined from <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span> is in the plane through the parallel straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
