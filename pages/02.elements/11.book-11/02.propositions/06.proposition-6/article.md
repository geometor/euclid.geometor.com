<p><hi rend="ital">If two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the straight lines will be parallel.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane</span>, <span class="ital">the straight lines will be parallel.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let them meet the plane of reference at the points <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, let the straight line <span class="ital">BD</span> be joined, let <span class="ital">DE</span> be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to <span class="ital">BD</span>, let <span class="ital">DE</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> is in the plane of reference and meets <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore each of the angles <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">ABE</span> is right. </p>

<p>For the same reason each of the angles <span class="ital">CDB</span>, <span class="ital">CDE</span> is also right. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>, and <span class="ital">BD</span> is common, the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>; and they include right angles; therefore the base <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">BE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>, while <span class="ital">AD</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">BE</span>, the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>; and <span class="ital">AE</span> is their common base; therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDA</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] <pb n="284"/></p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="ital">EDA</span> is also right; therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> is at right angles to <span class="ital">DA</span>. </p>

<p>But it is also at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> is set up at right angles to the three straight lines <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> at their point of meeting; therefore the three straight lines <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> are in one plane. [<a href="/elem.11.5">XI. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But, in whatever plane <span class="ital">DB</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span> are, in that plane is <span class="ital">AB</span> also, for every triangle is in one plane; [<a href="/elem.11.2">XI. 2</a>] therefore the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> are in one plane. </p>

<p>And each of the angles <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">BDC</span> is right; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.28">I. 28</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
