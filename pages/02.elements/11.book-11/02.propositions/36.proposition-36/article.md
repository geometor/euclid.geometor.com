<h1>PROPOSITION 36.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If three straight lines be proportional</span>, <span class="ital">the parallelepipedal solid formed out of the three is equal to the parallelepipedal solid on the mean which is equilateral</span>, <span class="ital">but equiangular with the aforesaid solid.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be three straight lines in proportion, so that, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that the solid formed out of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the solid on <span class="ital">B</span> which is equilateral, but equiangular with the aforesaid solid. </p>

<p>Let there be set out the solid angle at <span class="ital">E</span> contained by the angles <span class="ital">DEG</span>, <span class="ital">GEF</span>, <span class="ital">FED</span>, <pb n="357"/>let each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">B</span>, and let the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">EK</span> be completed, let <span class="ital">LM</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, and on the straight line <span class="ital">LM</span>, and at the point <span class="ital">L</span> on it, let there be constructed a solid angle equal to the solid angle at <span class="ital">E</span>, namely that contained by <span class="ital">NLO</span>, <span class="ital">OLM</span>, <span class="ital">MLN</span>; let <span class="ital">LO</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">B</span>, and <span class="ital">LN</span> equal to <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>, while <span class="ital">A</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span>, and <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">LN</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">LM</span> is to <span class="ital">EF</span>, so is <span class="ital">DE</span> to <span class="ital">LN</span>. </p>

<p>Thus the sides about the equal angles <span class="ital">NLM</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span> are reciprocally proportional; therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">MN</span> is equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.14">VI. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the angles <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">NLM</span> are two plane rectilineal angles, and on them the elevated straight lines <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span> are set up which are equal to one another and contain equal angles with the original straight lines respectively, therefore the perpendiculars drawn from the points <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> to the planes through <span class="ital">NL</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span> and <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.11.35">XI. 35</a>, Por.] hence the solids <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span> are of the same height. </p>

<p>But parallelepipedal solids on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.11.31">XI. 31</a>] therefore the solid <span class="ital">HL</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">EK</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">LH</span> is the solid formed out of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, and <span class="ital">EK</span> the solid on <span class="ital">B</span>; <pb n="358"/>therefore the parallelepipedal solid formed out of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the solid on <span class="ital">B</span> which is equilateral, but equiangular with the aforesaid solid.
