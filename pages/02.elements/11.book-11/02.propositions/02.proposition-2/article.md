<h1>PROPOSITION 2.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines cut one another</span>, <span class="ital">they are in one plane</span>, <span class="ital">and every triangle is in one plane.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> cut one another at the point <span class="ital">E</span>; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane. 
      </p>

<p>For let points <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> be taken at random on <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, let <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> be joined, and let <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> be drawn across; I say first that the triangle <span class="ital">ECB</span> is in one plane. </p>

<p>For, if part of the triangle <span class="ital">ECB</span>, either <span class="ital">FHC</span> or <span class="ital">GBK</span>, is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of one of the straight lines <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> will be in the plane of reference, and a part in another. </p>

<p>But, if the part <span class="ital">FCBG</span> of the triangle <span class="ital">ECB</span> be in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of both the straight lines <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> will be in the plane of reference and a part in another: which was proved absurd. [<a href="/elem.11.1">XI. 1</a>] <pb n="275"/></p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ECB</span> is in one plane. </p>

<p>But, in whatever plane the triangle <span class="ital">ECB</span> is, in that plane also is each of the straight lines <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, and, in whatever plane each of the straight lines <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is, in that plane are <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> also. [<a href="/elem.11.1">XI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane. Q. E. D.</p>
