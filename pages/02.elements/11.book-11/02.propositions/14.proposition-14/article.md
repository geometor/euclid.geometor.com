<h1>PROPOSITION 14.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Planes to which the same straight line is at right angles will be parallel.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let any straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be at right angles to each of the planes <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>; I say that the planes are parallel. 
      </p>

<p>For, if not, they will meet when produced. </p>

<p>Let them meet; they will then make, as common section, a straight line. [<a href="/elem.11.3">XI. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Let them make <span class="ital">GH</span>; let a point <span class="ital">K</span> be taken at random on <span class="ital">GH</span>, and let <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">BK</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to <span class="ital">BK</span> which is a straight line in the plane <span class="ital">EF</span> produced; [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABK</span> is right. </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">BAK</span> is also right. </p>

<p>Thus, in the triangle <span class="ital">ABK</span>, the two angles <span class="ital">ABK</span>, <span class="ital">BAK</span> are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.1.17">I. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the planes <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> will not meet when produced; therefore the planes <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are parallel. [<a href="/elem.11.def.8">XI. Def. 8</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore planes to which the same straight line is at right angles are parallel. Q. E. D.</p>
