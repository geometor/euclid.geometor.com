      </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If a straight line be at right angles to any plane</span>, <span class="ital">all the planes through it will also be at right angles to the same plane.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let any straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that all the planes through <span class="ital">AB</span> are also at right angles to the plane of reference. 
      </p>

<p>For let the plane <span class="ital">DE</span> be drawn through <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">CE</span> be the common section of the plane <span class="ital">DE</span> and the plane of reference, let a point <span class="ital">F</span> be taken at random on <span class="ital">CE</span>, and from <span class="ital">F</span> let <span class="ital">FG</span> be drawn in the plane <span class="ital">DE</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">CE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.11">I. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, <pb n="303"/><span class="ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] so that it is also at right angles to <span class="ital">CE</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABF</span> is right. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">GFB</span> is also right; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.28">I. 28</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is also at right angles to the plane of reference. [<a href="/elem.11.8">XI. 8</a>] </p>

<p>Now a plane is at right angles to a plane, when the straight lines drawn, in one of the planes, at right angles to the common section of the planes are at right angles to the remaining plane. [<a href="/elem.11.def.4">XI. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">FG</span>, drawn in one of the planes <span class="ital">DE</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">CE</span>, the common section of the planes, was proved to be at right angles to the plane of reference; therefore the plane <span class="ital">DE</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Similarly also it can be proved that all the planes through <span class="ital">AB</span> are at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
