<h1>PROPOSITION 11.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">From a given elevated point to draw a straight line perpendicular to a given plane.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be the given elevated point, and the plane of reference the given plane; thus it is required to draw from the point <span class="ital">A</span> a straight line perpendicular to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Let any straight line <span class="ital">BC</span> be drawn, at random, in the plane of reference, and let <span class="ital">AD</span> be drawn from the point <span class="ital">A</span> perpendicular to <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.12">I. 12</a>] 
      </p>

<p>If then <span class="ital">AD</span> is also perpendicular to the plane of reference, that which was enjoined will have been done. </p>

<p>But, if not, let <span class="ital">DE</span> be drawn from the point <span class="ital">D</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">BC</span> and in the plane of reference, [<a href="/elem.1.11">I. 11</a>] let <span class="ital">AF</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">A</span> perpendicular to <span class="ital">DE</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.12">I. 12</a>] and let <span class="ital">GH</span> be drawn through the point <span class="ital">F</span> parallel to <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">BC</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DA</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.4">XI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">GH</span> is parallel to it; but, if two straight lines be parallel, and one of them be at right angles to any plane, the remaining one will also be at right angles to the same plane; [<a href="/elem.11.8">XI. 8</a>] therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>. <pb n="293"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AF</span> meets it and is in the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>; therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is at right angles to <span class="ital">FA</span>, so that <span class="ital">FA</span> is also at right angles to <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AF</span> is also at right angles to <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>But, if a straight line be set up at right angles to two straight lines which cut one another, at the point of section, it will also be at right angles to the plane through them; [<a href="/elem.11.4">XI. 4</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FA</span> is at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>But the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> is the plane of reference; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

<p>Therefore from the given elevated point <span class="ital">A</span> the straight line <span class="ital">AF</span> has been drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference. Q. E. F.</p>
