<p><hi rend="ital">If two planes cut one another</hi>, <hi rend="ital">their common section is a straight line.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two planes cut one another</span>, <span class="ital">their common section is a straight line.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> cut one another, and let the line <span class="ital">DB</span> be their common section; I say that the line <span class="ital">DB</span> is a straight line. 
      </p>

<p>For, if not, from <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">B</span> let the straight line <span class="ital">DEB</span> be joined in the plane <span class="ital">AB</span>, and in the plane <span class="ital">BC</span> the straight line <span class="ital">DFB</span>. </p>

<p>Then the two straight lines <span class="ital">DEB</span>, <span class="ital">DFB</span> will have the same extremities, and will clearly enclose an area: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DEB</span>, <span class="ital">DFB</span> are not straight lines. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither will there be any other straight line joined from <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">B</span> except <span class="ital">DB</span> the common section of the planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
