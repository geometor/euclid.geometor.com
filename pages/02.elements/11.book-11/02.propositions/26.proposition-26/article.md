<h1>PROPOSITION 26.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">On a given straight line, and at a given point on it</span>, <span class="ital">to construct a solid angle equal to a given solid angle.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the given straight line, <span class="ital">A</span> the given point on it, and the angle at <span class="ital">D</span>, contained by the angles <span class="ital">EDC</span>, <span class="ital">EDF</span>, <span class="ital">FDC</span>, the given solid angle; thus it is required to construct on the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span>, and at the point <span class="ital">A</span> on it, a solid angle equal to the solid angle at <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let a point <span class="ital">F</span> be taken at random on <span class="ital">DF</span>, let <span class="ital">FG</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">F</span> perpendicular to the plane through <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>, and let it meet the plane at <span class="ital">G</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.11">XI. 11</a>] let <span class="ital">DG</span> be joined, let there be constructed on the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and at the point <span class="ital">A</span> on it the angle <span class="ital">BAL</span> equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDC</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">BAK</span> equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDG</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] let <span class="ital">AK</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">DG</span>, <pb n="328"/>let <span class="ital">KH</span> be set up from the point <span class="ital">K</span> at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AL</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.12">XI. 12</a>] let <span class="ital">KH</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">GF</span>, and let <span class="ital">HA</span> be joined; I say that the solid angle at <span class="ital">A</span>, contained by the angles <span class="ital">BAL</span>, <span class="ital">BAH</span>, <span class="ital">HAL</span> is equal to the solid angle at <span class="ital">D</span> contained by the angles <span class="ital">EDC</span>, <span class="ital">EDF</span>, <span class="ital">FDC</span>. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> be cut off equal to one another, and let <span class="ital">HB</span>, <span class="ital">KB</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">FG</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore each of the angles <span class="ital">FGD</span>, <span class="ital">FGE</span> is right. </p>

<p>For the same reason each of the angles <span class="ital">HKA</span>, <span class="ital">HKB</span> is also right. </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">KA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">GD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> respectively, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">KB</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">GE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KH</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">GF</span>, and they contain right angles; therefore <span class="ital">HB</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">FE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since the two sides <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">DG</span>, <span class="ital">GF</span>, and they contain right angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">AH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore the two sides <span class="ital">HA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>And the base <span class="ital">HB</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">FE</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">BAH</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDF</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">HAL</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">FDC</span>. </p>

<p>And the angle <span class="ital">BAL</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">EDC</span>. <pb n="329"/></p>

<p>Therefore on the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span>, and at the point <span class="ital">A</span> on it, a solid angle has been constructed equal to the given solid angle at <span class="ital">D</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
