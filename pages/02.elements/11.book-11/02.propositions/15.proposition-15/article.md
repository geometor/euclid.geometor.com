<h1>PROPOSITION 15.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines meeting one another be parallel to two straight lines meeting one another</span>, <span class="ital">not being in the same plane</span>, <span class="ital">the planes through them are parallel.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> meeting one another be parallel to the two straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> meeting one another, not being in the same plane; I say that the planes produced through <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> and <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> will not meet one another. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BG</span> be drawn from the point <span class="ital">B</span> perpendicular to the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> [<a href="/elem.11.11">XI. 11</a>], and let it meet the plane at the point <span class="ital">G</span>; through <span class="ital">G</span> let <span class="ital">GH</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="ital">ED</span>, and <span class="ital">GK</span> parallel to <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">BG</span> is at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But each of the straight lines <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> meets it and is in the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore each of the angles <span class="ital">BGH</span>, <span class="ital">BGK</span> is right. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BA</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">GH</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.9">XI. 9</a>] therefore the angles <span class="ital">GBA</span>, <span class="ital">BGH</span> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">BGH</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="ital">GBA</span> is also right; therefore <span class="ital">GB</span> is at right angles to <span class="ital">BA</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">GB</span> is also at right angles to <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Since then the straight line <span class="ital">GB</span> is set up at right angles to the two straight lines <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> which cut one another, therefore <span class="ital">GB</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.4">XI. 4</a>] <pb n="298"/></p>

<p>But planes to which the same straight line is at right angles are parallel; [<a href="/elem.11.14">XI. 14</a>] therefore the plane through <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is parallel to the plane through <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, if two straight lines meeting one another be parallel to two straight lines meeting one another, not in the same plane, the planes through them are parallel. Q. E. D.</p>
