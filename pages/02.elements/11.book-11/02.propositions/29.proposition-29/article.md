<p><span class="ital">Parallelepipedal solids which are on the same base and of the same height</span>, <span class="ital">and in which the extremities of the sides which stand up are on the same straight lines</span>, <span class="ital">are equal to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">CN</span> be parallelepipedal solids on the same base <span class="ital">AB</span> and of the same height, and let the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">LN</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">BH</span>, <span class="ital">BK</span>, be on the same straight lines <span class="ital">FN</span>, <span class="ital">DK</span>; I say that the solid <span class="ital">CM</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CN</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since each of the figures <span class="ital">CH</span>, <span class="ital">CK</span> is a parallelogram, <span class="ital">CB</span> is equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] hence <span class="ital">DH</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">EK</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">EH</span> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">DE</span> is equal to the remainder <span class="ital">HK</span>. </p>

<p>Hence the triangle <span class="ital">DCE</span> is also equal to the triangle <span class="ital">HBK</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.8 elem.1.4">I. 8, 4</a>] and the parallelogram <span class="ital">DG</span> to the parallelogram <span class="ital">HN</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.36">I. 36</a>] <pb n="334"/></p>

<p>For the same reason the triangle <span class="ital">AFG</span> is also equal to the triangle <span class="ital">MLN</span>. </p>

<p>But the parallelogram <span class="ital">CF</span> is equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">BM</span>, and <span class="ital">CG</span> to <span class="ital">BN</span>, for they are opposite; therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="ital">AFG</span>, <span class="ital">DCE</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DG</span>, <span class="ital">CG</span> is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="ital">MLN</span>, <span class="ital">HBK</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="ital">BM</span>, <span class="ital">HN</span>, <span class="ital">BN</span>. </p>

<p>Let there be added to each the solid of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">AB</span> is the base and <span class="ital">GEHM</span> its opposite; therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">CM</span> is equal to the whole parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">CN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
