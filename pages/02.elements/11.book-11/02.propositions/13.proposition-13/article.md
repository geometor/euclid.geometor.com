<h1>PROPOSITION 13.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">From the same point two straight lines cannot be set up at right angles to the same plane on the same side.</span>
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, from the same point <span class="ital">A</span> let the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> be set up at right angles to the plane of reference and on the same side, and let a plane be drawn through <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>; it will then make, as section through <span class="ital">A</span> in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<a href="/elem.11.3">XI. 3</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let it make <span class="ital">DAE</span>; therefore the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DAE</span> are in one plane. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">CA</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DAE</span> meets it and is in the plane of reference; therefore the angle <span class="ital">CAE</span> is right. </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">BAE</span> is also right; therefore the angle <span class="ital">CAE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">BAE</span>. </p>

<p>And they are in one plane: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
