<h1>PROPOSITION 12.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">To set up a straight line at right angles to a given plane from a given point in it.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the plane of reference be the given plane, and <span class="ital">A</span> the point in it; thus it is required to set up from the point <span class="ital">A</span> a straight line at right angles to the plane of reference. 
      </p>

<p>Let any elevated point <span class="ital">B</span> be conceived, from <span class="ital">B</span> let <span class="ital">BC</span> be drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference, [<a href="/elem.11.11">XI. 11</a>] and through the point <span class="ital">A</span> let <span class="ital">AD</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are two parallel straight lines, while one of them, <span class="ital">BC</span>, is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore the remaining one, <span class="ital">AD</span>, is also at right angles to the plane of reference. [<a href="/elem.11.8">XI. 8</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> has been set up at right angles to the given plane from the point <span class="ital">A</span> in it.</p>
