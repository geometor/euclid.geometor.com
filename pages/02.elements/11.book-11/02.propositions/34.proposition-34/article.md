<h1>PROPOSITION 34.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">In equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those parallelepipedal solids in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be equal parallelepipedal solids; I say that in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>First, let the sides which stand up, namely <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">LB</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, <span class="ital">PD</span>, <span class="ital">QR</span>, be at right angles to their bases; I say that, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is <span class="ital">CM</span> to <span class="ital">AG</span>. </p>

<p>If now the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, while the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> will also be equal to <span class="ital">AG</span>. <pb n="346"/></p>

<p>For parallelepipedal solids of the same height are to one another as the bases; [<a href="/elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] and, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so will <span class="ital">CM</span> be to <span class="ital">AG</span>, and it is manifest that in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>

<p>Next, let the base <span class="ital">EH</span> not be equal to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, but let <span class="ital">EH</span> be greater. 
      </p>

<p>Now the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">AG</span>. </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">CT</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AG</span>, and let the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">VC</span> be completed on <span class="ital">NQ</span> as base and with <span class="ital">CT</span> as height. </p>

<p>Now, since the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>, and <span class="ital">CV</span> is outside them, while equals have to the same the same ratio, [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] therefore, as the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>, so is the base <span class="ital">EH</span> to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, for the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CV</span> are of equal height; [<a href="/elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] and, as the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>, so is the base <span class="ital">MQ</span> to the base <span class="ital">TQ</span> [<a href="/elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] and <span class="ital">CM</span> to <span class="ital">CT</span> [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>]; therefore also, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is <span class="ital">MC</span> to <span class="ital">CT</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CT</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AG</span>; therefore also, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is <span class="ital">MC</span> to <span class="ital">AG</span>. <pb n="347"/></p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>

<p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so let the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> be to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Let the sides which stand up be again at right angles to the bases. </p>

<p>Now, if the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, and, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> is also equal to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>But parallelepipedal solids on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.11.31">XI. 31</a>] therefore the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let the base <span class="ital">EH</span> not be equal to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, but let <span class="ital">EH</span> be greater; therefore the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> is also greater than the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>, that is, <span class="ital">CM</span> is greater than <span class="ital">AG</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">CT</span> be again made equal to <span class="ital">AG</span>, and let the solid <span class="ital">CV</span> be similarly completed. </p>

<p>Since, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is <span class="ital">MC</span> to <span class="ital">AG</span>, while <span class="ital">AG</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CT</span>, therefore, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is <span class="ital">CM</span> to <span class="ital">CT</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>, for the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CV</span> are of equal height; [<a href="/elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] and, as <span class="ital">CM</span> is to <span class="ital">CT</span>, so is the base <span class="ital">MQ</span> to the base <span class="ital">QT</span> [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the solid <span class="ital">CV</span>; therefore each of the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> has to <span class="ital">CV</span> the same ratio. <pb n="348"/></p>

<p>Therefore the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Now let the sides which stand up, <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">BL</span>, <span class="ital">GA</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">ON</span>, <span class="ital">DP</span>, <span class="ital">MC</span>, <span class="ital">RQ</span>, not be at right angles to their bases; let perpendiculars be drawn from the points <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">R</span> to the planes through <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span>, and let them meet the planes at <span class="ital">S</span>, <span class="ital">T</span>, <span class="ital">U</span>, <span class="ital">V</span>, <span class="ital">W</span>, <span class="ital">X</span>, <span class="ital">Y</span>, <span class="ital">a</span>, and let the solids <span class="ital">FV</span>, <span class="ital">Oa</span> be completed; I say that, in this case too, if the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are equal, the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Since the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BT</span>, for they are on the same base <span class="ital">FK</span> and of the same height; [<a href="/elem.11.29 elem.11.30">XI. 29, 30</a>] and the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DX</span>, for they are again on the same base <span class="ital">RO</span> and of the same height; [<span class="ital">id.</span>] therefore the solid <span class="ital">BT</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">DX</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the base <span class="ital">FK</span> is to the base <span class="ital">OR</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">DX</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">BT</span>. [Part 1.] </p>

<p>But the base <span class="ital">FK</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">EH</span>, and the base <span class="ital">OR</span> to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>; therefore, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">DX</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">BT</span>. <pb n="349"/></p>

<p>But the solids <span class="ital">DX</span>, <span class="ital">BT</span> and the solids <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">BA</span> have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">DC</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>

<p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so let the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> be to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, since, as the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">NQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>, while the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">FK</span>, and <span class="ital">NQ</span> to <span class="ital">OR</span>, therefore, as the base <span class="ital">FK</span> is to the base <span class="ital">OR</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>But the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> and <span class="ital">BT</span>, <span class="ital">DX</span> have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base <span class="ital">FK</span> is to the base <span class="ital">OR</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="ital">DX</span> to the height of the solid <span class="ital">BT</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">BT</span>, <span class="ital">DX</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; therefore the solid <span class="ital">BT</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">DX</span>. [Part 1.] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BT</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BA</span>, for they are on the same base <span class="ital">FK</span> and of the same height; [<a href="/elem.11.29 elem.11.30">XI. 29, 30</a>] and the solid <span class="ital">DX</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">DC</span>. [<span class="ital">id.</span>] </p>

<p>Therefore the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
