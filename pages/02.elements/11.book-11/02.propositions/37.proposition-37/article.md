<p><hi rend="ital">If four straight lines be proportional</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described will also be proportional; and</hi>, <hi rend="ital">if the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described be proportional</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the straight lines will themselves also be proportional.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If four straight lines be proportional</span>, <span class="ital">the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described will also be proportional; and</span>, <span class="ital">if the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described be proportional</span>, <span class="ital">the straight lines will themselves also be proportional.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">EF</span> to <span class="ital">GH</span>; and let there be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> the similar and similarly situated parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">KA</span>, <span class="ital">LC</span>, <span class="ital">ME</span>, <span class="ital">NG</span>; I say that, as <span class="ital">KA</span> is to <span class="ital">LC</span>, so is <span class="ital">ME</span> to <span class="ital">NG</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">KA</span> is similar to <span class="ital">LC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">KA</span> has to <span class="ital">LC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.33">XI. 33</a>] <pb n="359"/></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">ME</span> also has to <span class="ital">NG</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">EF</span> has to <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">EF</span> to <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <span class="ital">AK</span> is to <span class="ital">LC</span>, so is <span class="ital">ME</span> to <span class="ital">NG</span>. </p>

<p>Next, as the solid <span class="ital">AK</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">LC</span>, so let the solid <span class="ital">ME</span> be to the solid <span class="ital">NG</span>; I say that, as the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">EF</span> to <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>For since, again, <span class="ital">KA</span> has to <span class="ital">LC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">CD</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.33">XI. 33</a>] and <span class="ital">ME</span> also has to <span class="ital">NG</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">EF</span> has to <span class="ital">GH</span>, [<span class="ital">id</span>.] and, as <span class="ital">KA</span> is to <span class="ital">LC</span>, so is <span class="ital">ME</span> to <span class="ital">NG</span>, therefore also, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">EF</span> to <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
