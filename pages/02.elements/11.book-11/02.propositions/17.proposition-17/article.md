===

<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines be cut by parallel planes</span>, <span class="ital">they will be cut in the same ratios.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be cut by the parallel planes <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">MN</span> at the points <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> and <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that, as the straight line <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> be joined, let <span class="ital">AD</span> meet the plane <span class="ital">KL</span> at the point <span class="ital">O</span>, and let <span class="ital">EO</span>, <span class="ital">OF</span> be joined. <pb n="302"/></p>

<p>Now, since the two parallel planes <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">MN</span> are cut by the plane <span class="ital">EBDO</span>, their common sections <span class="ital">EO</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> are parallel. [<a href="/elem.11.16">XI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason, since the two parallel planes <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> are cut by the plane <span class="ital">AOFC</span>, their common sections <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">OF</span> are parallel. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] </p>

<p>And, since the straight line <span class="ital">EO</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="ital">BD</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span>, therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">AO</span> to <span class="ital">OD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since the straight line <span class="ital">OF</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="ital">AC</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="ital">ADC</span>, proportionally, as <span class="ital">AO</span> is to <span class="ital">OD</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] </p>

<p>But it was also proved that, as <span class="ital">AO</span> is to <span class="ital">OD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">EB</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
