       <hi rend="ital">Straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are also parallel to one another.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are also parallel to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be parallel to <span class="ital">EF</span>, not being in the same plane with it; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let a point <span class="ital">G</span> be taken at random on <span class="ital">EF</span>, and from it let there be drawn <span class="ital">GH</span>, in the plane through <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>, at right angles to <span class="ital">EF</span>, and <span class="ital">GK</span> in the plane through <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> again at right angles to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">EF</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.4">XI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EF</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">HG</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.8">XI. 8</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">HG</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> is at right angles to the plane through <span class="ital">HG</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. </p>

<p>But if two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane, the straight lines are parallel; [<a href="/elem.11.6">XI. 6</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">CD</span>.</p>
