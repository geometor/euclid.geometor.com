===

<p><span class="ital">If a solid angle be contained by three plane angles</span>, <span class="ital">any two</span>, <span class="ital">taken together in any manner</span>, <span class="ital">are greater than the remaining one.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the solid angle at <span class="ital">A</span> be contained by the three plane angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">DAB</span>; I say that any two of the angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">DAB</span>, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one. 
      </p>

<p>If now the angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">DAB</span> are equal to one another, it is manifest that any two are greater than the remaining one. </p>

<p>But, if not, let <span class="ital">BAC</span> be greater, and on the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span>, and at the point <span class="ital">A</span> on it, let the <pb n="308"/>angle <span class="ital">BAE</span> be constructed, in the plane through <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, equal to the angle <span class="ital">DAB</span>; let <span class="ital">AE</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AD</span>, and let <span class="ital">BEC</span>, drawn across through the point <span class="ital">E</span>, cut the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> at the points <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; let <span class="ital">DB</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">DA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AE</span>, and <span class="ital">AB</span> is common, two sides are equal to two sides; and the angle <span class="ital">DAB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">BAE</span>; therefore the base <span class="ital">DB</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">BE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> are greater than <span class="ital">BC</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>] and of these <span class="ital">DB</span> was proved equal to <span class="ital">BE</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">DC</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="ital">EC</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">DA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AE</span>, and <span class="ital">AC</span> is common, and the base <span class="ital">DC</span> is greater than the base <span class="ital">EC</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">DAC</span> is greater than the angle <span class="ital">EAC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.25">I. 25</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">DAB</span> was also proved equal to the angle <span class="ital">BAE</span>; therefore the angles <span class="ital">DAB</span>, <span class="ital">DAC</span> are greater than the angle <span class="ital">BAC</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the remaining angles also, taken together two and two, are greater than the remaining one. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
