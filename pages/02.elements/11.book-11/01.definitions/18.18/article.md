<p>When, one side of those about the right angle in a right-angled triangle remaining fixed, the triangle is carried round and restored again to the same position from which it began to be moved, the figure so comprehended is a <span class="bold">cone.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, if the straight line which remains fixed be equal to the remaining side about the right angle which is carried round, the cone will be <span class="bold">right-angled</span>; if less, <span class="bold">obtuse-angled</span>; and if greater, <span class="bold">acute-angled.</span></p>
