<h1>Proposition 43.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a parallelogram, and <em>AC</em> its diameter; and about <em>AC</em> let <em>EH</em>, <em>FG</em> be parallelograms, and <em>BK</em>, <em>KD</em>
        <lb n="5"/>the so-called complements;</p>

       
<p>I say that the complement <em>BK</em> is equal to the complement <em>KD</em>.</p>

       
<p>For, since <em>ABCD</em> is a parallelogram, and <em>AC</em> its diameter, <span class="center">the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to <lb n="10"/>the triangle <em>ACD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span></p>

       
<p>Again, since <em>EH</em> is a parallelogram, and <em>AK</em> is its diameter, <span class="center">the triangle <em>AEK</em> is equal to the triangle <em>AHK</em>.</span>
        
        <lb n="15"/>For the same reason <span class="center">the triangle <em>KFC</em> is also equal to <em>KGC</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>Now, since the triangle <em>AEK</em> is equal to the triangle <em>AHK</em>, <span class="center">and <em>KFC</em> to <em>KGC</em>,</span>
        <lb n="20"/>the triangle <em>AEK</em> together with <em>KGC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>AHK</em> together with <em>KFC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]</p>

       
<p>And the whole triangle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the whole <em>ADC</em>; therefore the complement <em>BK</em> which remains is equal to the <lb n="25"/>complement <em>KD</em> which remains. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C.N. 3</a>]</p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>

<p>Q. E. D.</p>

<p><span class="bold">complements</span>, <foreign lang="greek">παραπληρώματα</foreign>, the figures put in to fill up (interstices).</p>

      </blockquote><blockquote n="4. and about AC...." class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       
<p>Euclid's phraseology here and in the next proposition implies that the complements as well as the other parallelograms are <quote>about</quote>
 the diagonal. The words are here <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δὲ τὴν ΑΓ παραλληλόγραμμα μὲν ἔστω τὰ ΕΘ, ΖΗ, τὰ δὲ λεγόμενα παραπληρώματα τὰ ΒΚ, ΚΔ</foreign>. The expression <quote>the so-called complements</quote>
 indicates that this technical use of <foreign lang="greek">παραπληρώματα</foreign> was not new, though it might not be universally known.</p>
