<h1>Proposition 13.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>For let any straight line <em>AB</em> set up on the straight line <lb n="5"/><em>CD</em> make the angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>ABD</em>;</p>

       
<p>I say that the angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>ABD</em> are either two right angles or equal to two right angles. </p>

       
<p>Now, if the angle <em>CBA</em> is equal to <lb n="10"/>the angle <em>ABD</em>, <span class="center">they are two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">Def. 10</a>]</span></p>

       
<p>But, if not, let <em>BE</em> be drawn from the point <em>B</em> at right angles to <em>CD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.11">I. 11</a>] <span class="center">therefore the angles <em>CBE</em>, <em>EBD</em> are two right angles.</span>
        <lb n="15"/></p>

       
<p>Then, since the angle <em>CBE</em> is equal to the two angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>ABE</em>, <span class="center">let the angle <em>EBD</em> be added to each; therefore the angles <em>CBE</em>, <em>EBD</em> are equal to the three angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>ABE</em>, <em>EBD</em>. [<title>C. N</title>. 2]</span>
        <lb n="20"/></p>

       
<p>Again, since the angle <em>DBA</em> is equal to the two angles <em>DBE</em>, <em>EBA</em>, <span class="center">let the angle <em>ABC</em> be added to each; therefore the angles <em>DBA</em>. <em>ABC</em> are equal to the three angles <em>DBE</em>, <em>EBA</em>, <em>ABC</em>. [<title>C. N</title>. 2]</span>
        <lb n="25"/></p>

       
<p>But the angles <em>CBE</em>, <em>EBD</em> were also proved equal to the same three angles; <span class="center">and things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [<title>C. N</title>. 1] therefore the angles <em>CBE</em>, <em>EBD</em> are also equal to the <lb n="30"/>angles <em>DBA</em>, <em>ABC</em>.</span>
        <pb n="276"/>But the angles <em>CBE</em>, <em>EBD</em> are two right angles; <span class="center">therefore the angles <em>DBA</em>, <em>ABC</em> are also equal to two right angles.</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>

      </div><div class="QED">
       
<p>Q. E. D.</p>

      </div><blockquote n="17. let the angle EBD be added to each," class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       
<p>literally <quote>let the angle <em>EBD</em> be added (so as to be) common,</quote>
 <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ προσκείσθω ἡ ὑπὸ ΕΒΔ</foreign>. Similarly <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ ἀφηρήσθω</foreign> is used of subtracting a straight line or angle from each of two others. <quote>Let the common angle <em>EBD</em> be added</quote>
 is clearly an inaccurate translation, for the angle is not common before it is added, i.e. the <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ</foreign> is proleptic. <quote>Let the common angle be <em>subtracted</em></quote>
 as a translation of <foreign lang="greek">κοινὴ ἀφηρήσθω</foreign> would be less unsatisfactory, it is true, but, as it is desirable to use corresponding words when translating the two expressions, it seems hopeless to attempt to keep the word <quote>common,</quote>
 and I have therefore said <quote>to each</quote>
 and <quote>from each</quote>
 simply.</p>
