<h1>Proposition 6.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a triangle having the angle <em>ABC</em> equal to the angle <em>ACB</em>;</p>

       
<p>I say that the side <em>AB</em> is also equal to the side <em>AC</em>.</p>

       
<p>For, if <em>AB</em> is unequal to <em>AC</em>, one of them is greater.</p>

       
<p>Let <em>AB</em> be greater; and from <em>AB</em> the greater let <em>DB</em> be cut off equal to <em>AC</em> the less;</p>

       
<p>let <em>DC</em> be joined. </p>

       
<p>Then, since <em>DB</em> is equal to <em>AC</em>, and <em>BC</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>DB</em>, <em>BC</em> are equal to the two sides <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em> respectively;</span>
        <pb n="256"/>and the angle <em>DBC</em> is equal to the angle <em>ACB</em>; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>DC</em> is equal to the base <em>AB</em>, and the triangle <em>DBC</em> will be equal to the triangle <em>ACB</em>, the less to the greater: which is absurd. Therefore <em>AB</em> is not unequal to <em>AC</em>; it is therefore equal to it.</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>
