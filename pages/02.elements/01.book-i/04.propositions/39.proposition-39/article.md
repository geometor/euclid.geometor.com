<h1>Proposition 39.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DBC</em> be equal triangles which are on the same base <em>BC</em> and on the same side of it; <lb n="5"/>[I say that they are also in the same parallels.]</p>

       
<p>And [For] let <em>AD</em> be joined; I say that <em>AD</em> is parallel to <em>BC</em>.</p>

       
<p>For, if not, let <em>AE</em> be drawn through the point <em>A</em> parallel to the straight line <lb n="10"/><em>BC</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] and let <em>EC</em> be joined. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>EBC</em>; for it is on the same base <em>BC</em> with it and in the same <lb n="15"/>parallels. [<a href="/elem.1.37">I. 37</a>]</p>

       
<p>But <em>ABC</em> is equal to <em>DBC</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>DBC</em> is also equal to <em>EBC</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>] the greater to the less: which is impossible.</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore <em>AE</em> is not parallel to <em>BC</em>. <lb n="20"/></p>

       
<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except <em>AD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> is parallel to <em>BC</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>

<p>[<span class="bold">I say that they are also in the same parallels.</span>] Heiberg has proved (<title>Hermes</title>, XXXVIII., 1903, p. 50) from a recently discovered papyrus-fragment (<title>Fayūm towns and their papyri</title>, p. 96, No. IX.) that these words are an interpolation by some one who did not observe that the words <quote>And let <em>AD</em> be joined</quote>
 are part of the <em>setting-out</em> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔκθεσις</foreign>), but took them as belonging to the <em>construction</em> (<foreign lang="greek">κατασκευή</foreign>) and consequently thought that a <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> or <quote>definition</quote>
 (of the thing to be proved) should precede. The interpolator then altered <quote>And</quote>
 into <quote>For</quote>
 in the next sentence.</p>
