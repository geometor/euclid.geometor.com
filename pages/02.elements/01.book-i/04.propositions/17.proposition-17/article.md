<h1>Proposition 17.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a triangle; I say that two angles of the triangle <em>ABC</em> taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.</p>

       
<p>For let <em>BC</em> be produced to <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.post.2">Post. 2</a>]</p>

       
<p>Then, since the angle <em>ACD</em> is an exterior angle of the triangle <em>ABC</em>,</p>

       
<p>it is greater than the interior and opposite angle <em>ABC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.16">I. 16</a>] <pb n="282"/><span class="center">Let the angle <em>ACB</em> be added to each;</span> therefore the angles <em>ACD</em>, <em>ACB</em> are greater than the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BCA</em>.  But the angles <em>ACD</em>, <em>ACB</em> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.13">I. 13</a>]</p>

       
<p>Therefore the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BCA</em> are less than two right angles.</p>

       
<p>Similarly we can prove that the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>ACB</em> are also less than two right angles, and so are the angles <em>CAB</em>, <em>ABC</em> as well.</p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>
