<p><emph>Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels</emph>.</p>

===

<h1>Proposition 40.</h1>
<p><em>Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels</em>.</p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>CDE</em> be equal triangles on equal bases <em>BC</em>, <em>CE</em> and on the same side.</p>

<p>I say that they are also in the same parallels.</p>

<p>For let <em>AD</em> be joined; I say that <em>AD</em> is parallel to <em>BE</em>.</p>

<p>For, if not, let <em>AF</em> be drawn through <em>A</em> parallel to <em>BE</em> [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>], and let <em>FE</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>FCE</em>; for they are on equal bases <em>BC</em>, <em>CE</em> and in the same parallels <em>BE</em>, <em>AF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.38">I. 38</a>]</p>

<p>But the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>DCE</em>; <span class="center">therefore the triangle <em>DCE</em> is also equal to the triangle <em>FCE</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore <em>AF</em> is not parallel to <em>BE</em>.</span>
       <pb n="338"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except <em>AD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> is parallel to <em>BE</em>.</span></p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]</p>
