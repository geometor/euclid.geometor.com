<h1>Proposition 36.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABCD</em>, <em>EFGH</em> be parallelograms which are on equal bases <em>BC</em>, <em>FG</em> and in the same parallels <em>AH</em>, <em>BG</em>;  I say that the parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is equal to <em>EFGH</em>.</p>

       
<p>For let <em>BE</em>, <em>CH</em> be joined.</p>

       
<p>Then, since <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>FG</em> while <em>FG</em> is equal to <em>EH</em>, <span class="center"><em>BC</em> is also equal to <em>EH</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]</span></p>

       
<p>But they are also parallel.</p>

       
<p>And <em>EB</em>, <em>HC</em> join them; but straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are equal and parallel. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>]</p>

       
<p>Therefore <em>EBCH</em> is a parallelogram. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</p>

       
<p>And it is equal to <em>ABCD</em>; for it has the same base <em>BC</em> with it, and is in the same parallels <em>BC</em>, <em>AH</em> with it. [<a href="/elem.1.35">I. 35</a>]</p>

       
<p>For the same reason also <em>EFGH</em> is equal to the same <em>EBCH</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.35">I. 35</a>] so that the parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is also equal to <em>EFGH</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]</p>

       
<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
