<h1>PROPOSITION 34.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If a number neither be one of those which are continually doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd, it is both eventimes even and even-times odd</span>. </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> neither be one of those doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is both even-times even and even-times odd. 
      </p>

<p>Now that <span class="ital">A</span> is even-times even is manifest; for it has not its half odd. [<a href="/elem.7.def.8">VII. Def. 8</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also even-times odd. </p>

<p>For, if we bisect <span class="ital">A</span>, then bisect its half, and do this continually, we shall come upon some odd number which will measure <span class="ital">A</span> according to an even number. </p>

<p>For, if not, we shall come upon a dyad, and <span class="ital">A</span> will be among those which are doubled from a dyad: which is contrary to the hypothesis. <pb n="420"/></p>

<p>Thus <span class="ital">A</span> is even-times odd. </p>

<p>But it was also proved even-times even. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is both even-times even and even-times odd. Q. E. D.</p>
