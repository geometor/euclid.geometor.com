<h1>PROPOSITION 5.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a cube number by multiplying any number make a cube number, the multiplied number will also be cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the cube number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying any number <span class="ital">B</span> make the cube number <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">B</span> is cube. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is cube. [<a href="/elem.9.3">IX. 3</a>] <pb n="388"/></p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">D</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And since <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are cube, they are similar solid numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.19">VIII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also. [<a href="/elem.8.8">VIII. 8</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">A</span> is cube; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is also cube. [<a href="/elem.8.23">VIII. 23</a>]</p>
