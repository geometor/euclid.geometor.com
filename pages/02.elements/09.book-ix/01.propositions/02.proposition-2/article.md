<h1>PROPOSITION 2.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers by multiplying one another make a square number, they are similar plane numbers.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two numbers, and let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make the square number <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is square. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">D</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">D</span> is square, and <span class="ital">C</span> is so also, therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are similar plane numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore one mean proportional number falls between <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore one mean proportional number falls between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also. [<a href="/elem.8.18">VIII. 8</a>] </p>

<p>But, if one mean proportional number fall between two numbers, they are similar plane numbers; [<a href="/elem.8.20">VIII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers. Q. E. D.</p>
