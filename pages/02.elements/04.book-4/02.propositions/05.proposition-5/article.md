<p><emph>About a given triangle to circumscribe a circle</emph>. </p>

<p><em>About a given triangle to circumscribe a circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle <em>ABC</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>AC</em> be bisected at the points <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> [<a href="/elem.1.10">I. 10</a>], and from the points <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> let <em>DF</em>, <em>EF</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>AB</em>, <em>AC</em>; they will then meet within the triangle <em>ABC</em>, or on the straight line <em>BC</em>, or outside <em>BC</em>. <pb n="89"/></p>

<p>First let them meet within at <em>F</em>, and let <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em>, <em>FA</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>, and <em>DF</em> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <em>AF</em> is equal to the base <em>FB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="center"><em>CF</em> is also equal to <em>AF</em>;</span> so that <em>FB</em> is also equal to <em>FC</em>; <span class="center">therefore the three straight lines <em>FA</em>, <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em> are equal to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <em>F</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>FA</em>, <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em> will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Let it be circumscribed, as <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Next, let <em>DF</em>, <em>EF</em> meet on the straight line <em>BC</em> at <em>F</em>, as is the case in the second figure; and let <em>AF</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Again, let <em>DF</em>, <em>EF</em> meet outside the triangle <em>ABC</em> at <em>F</em>, as is the case in the third figure, and let <em>AF</em>, <em>BF</em>, <em>CF</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then again, since <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>, and <em>DF</em> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <em>AF</em> is equal to the base <em>BF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="center"><em>CF</em> is also equal to <em>AF</em>;</span> so that <em>BF</em> is also equal to <em>FC</em>; therefore the circle described with centre <em>F</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>FA</em>, <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em> will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F. </p>

<p>And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle <em>BAC</em>, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; <pb n="90"/>when the centre falls on the straight line <em>BC</em>, the angle <em>BAC</em>, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle <em>BAC</em>, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.
