<h1>PROPOSITION 7.</h1>
<p><em>About a given circle to circumscribe a square</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe a square about the circle <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Let two diameters <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> of the circle <em>ABCD</em> be drawn at right angles to one another, and through the points <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> let <em>FG</em>, <em>GH</em>, <em>HK</em>, <em>KF</em> be drawn touching the circle <em>ABCD</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Then, since <em>FG</em> touches the circle <em>ABCD</em>, and <em>EA</em> has been joined from the centre <em>E</em> to the point of contact at <em>A</em>, <span class="center">therefore the angles at <em>A</em> are right. [<a href="/elem.3.18">III. 18</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angles at the points <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> are also right.</span>
      </p>

<p>Now, since the angle <em>AEB</em> is right, and the angle <em>EBG</em> is also right, <span class="center">therefore <em>GH</em> is parailel to <em>AC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.28">I. 28</a>]</span>
       <pb n="93"/></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>AC</em> is also parallel to <em>FK</em>, so that <em>GH</em> is also parallel to <em>FK</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.30">I. 30</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="center">each of the straight lines <em>GF</em>, <em>HK</em> is parallel to <em>BED</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>GK</em>, <em>GC</em>, <em>AK</em>, <em>FB</em>, <em>BK</em> are parallelograms; therefore <em>GF</em> is equal to <em>HK</em>, and <em>GH</em> to <em>FK</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <em>AC</em> is equal to <em>BD</em>, and <em>AC</em> is also equal to each of the straight lines <em>GH</em>, <em>FK</em>, <span class="center">while <em>BD</em> is equal to each of the straight lines <em>GF</em>, <em>HK</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore the quadrilateral <em>FGHK</em> is equilateral.</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next that it is also right-angled. </p>

<p>For, since <em>GBEA</em> is a parallelogram, and the angle <em>AEB</em> is right, therefore the angle <em>AGB</em> is also right. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="center">the angles at <em>H</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>F</em> are also right.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>FGHK</em> is right-angled. </p>

<p>But it was also proved equilateral; <span class="center">therefore it is a square;</span> and it has been circumscribed about the circle <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore about the given circle a square has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
