<p><emph>In a given square to inscribe a circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a given square to inscribe a circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be the given square; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the given square <em>ABCD</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let the straight lines <em>AD</em>, <em>AB</em> be bisected at the points <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> respectively [<a href="/elem.1.10">I. 10</a>], through <em>E</em> let <em>EH</em> be drawn parallel to either <em>AB</em> or <em>CD</em>, and through <em>F</em> let <em>FK</em> be drawn parallel to either <em>AD</em> or <em>BC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] therefore each of the figures <em>AK</em>, <em>KB</em>, <em>AH</em>, <em>HD</em>, <em>AG</em>, <em>GC</em>, <em>BG</em>, <em>GD</em> is a parallelogram, and their opposite sides are evidently equal. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>, and <em>AE</em> is half of <em>AD</em>, and <em>AF</em> half of <em>AB</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>AF</em>, so that the opposite sides are also equal;</span>
       <span class="center">therefore <em>FG</em> is equal to <em>GE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines <em>GH</em>, <em>GK</em> is equal to each of the straight lines <em>FG</em>, <em>GE</em>; <span class="center">therefore the four straight lines <em>GE</em>, <em>GF</em>, <em>GH</em>, <em>GK</em> are equal to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <em>G</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>GE</em>, <em>GF</em>, <em>GH</em>, <em>GK</em> will pass also through the remaining points. </p>

<p>And it will touch the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DA</em>, because the angles at <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>K</em> are right. </p>

<p>For, if the circle cuts <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DA</em>, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [<a href="/elem.3.16">III. 16</a>] therefore the circle described with centre <em>G</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>GE</em>, <em>GF</em>, <em>GH</em>, <em>GK</em> will not cut the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DA</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore it will touch them, and will have been inscribed in the square <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore in the given square a circle has been inscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
