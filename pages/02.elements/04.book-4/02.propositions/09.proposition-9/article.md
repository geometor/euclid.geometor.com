<p><emph>About a given square to circumscribe a circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>About a given square to circumscribe a circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be the given square; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square <em>ABCD</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> be joined, and let them cut one another at <em>E</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>, and <em>AC</em> is common, therefore the two sides <em>DA</em>, <em>AC</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>; and the base <em>DC</em> is equal to the base <em>BC</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>DAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>BAC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>DAB</em> is bisected by <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that each of the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BCD</em>, <em>CDA</em> is bisected by the straight lines <em>AC</em>, <em>DB</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since the angle <em>DAB</em> is equal to the angle <em>ABC</em>, and the angle <em>EAB</em> is half the angle <em>DAB</em>, and the angle <em>EBA</em> half the angle <em>ABC</em>, therefore the angle <em>EAB</em> is also equal to the angle <em>EBA</em>; so that the side <em>EA</em> is also equal to <em>EB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines <em>EA</em>, <em>EB</em> is equal to each of the straight lines <em>EC</em>, <em>ED</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the four straight lines <em>EA</em>, <em>EB</em>, <em>EC</em>, <em>ED</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <em>E</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>EA</em>, <em>EB</em>, <em>EC</em>, <em>ED</em> will pass also through the remaining points; and it will have been circumscribed about the square <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Let it be circumscribed, as <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore about the given square a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
