<h1>PROPOSITION 16.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">Given two circles about the same centre</span>, <span class="ital">to inscribe in the greater circle an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle.</span>
       <pb n="424"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, <span class="ital">EFGH</span> be the two given circles about the same centre <span class="ital">K</span>; thus it is required to inscribe in the greater circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the straight line <span class="ital">BKD</span> be drawn through the centre <span class="ital">K</span>, and from the point <span class="ital">G</span> let <span class="ital">GA</span> be drawn at right angles to the straight line <span class="ital">BD</span> and carried through to <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> touches the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Then, bisecting the circumference <span class="ital">BAD</span>, bisecting the half of it, and doing this continually, we shall leave a circumference less than <span class="ital">AD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.1">X. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Let such be left, and let it be <span class="ital">LD</span>; from <span class="ital">L</span> let <span class="ital">LM</span> be drawn perpendicular to <span class="ital">BD</span> and carried through to <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">LD</span>, <span class="ital">DN</span> be joined; therefore <span class="ital">LD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DN</span>. [<a href="/elem.3.3">III. 3</a>, <a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">LN</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">AC</span>, and <span class="ital">AC</span> touches the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, therefore <span class="ital">LN</span> does not touch the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LD</span>, <span class="ital">DN</span> are far from touching the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. </p>

<p>If then we fit into the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> straight lines equal to the straight line <span class="ital">LD</span> and placed continuously, there will be inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
