<h1>PROPOSITION 2.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, <span class="ital">EFGH</span> be circles, and <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> their diameters; I say that, as the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is not to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> as the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, then, as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, so will the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> be either to some less area than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, or to a greater. </p>

<p>First, let it be in that ratio to a less area <span class="ital">S</span>. </p>

<p>Let the square <span class="ital">EFGH</span> be inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>; then the inscribed square is greater than the half of the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, inasmuch as, if through the points <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> we draw tangents to the circle, the square <span class="ital">EFGH</span> is half the square circumscribed about the circle, and the circle is less than the circumscribed square; hence the inscribed square <span class="ital">EFGH</span> is greater than the half of the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. </p>

<p>Let the circumferences <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span> be bisected at the points <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FL</span>, <span class="ital">LG</span>, <span class="ital">GM</span>, <span class="ital">MH</span>, <span class="ital">HN</span>, <span class="ital">NE</span> be joined; therefore each of the triangles <span class="ital">EKF</span>, <span class="ital">FLG</span>, <span class="ital">GMH</span>, <span class="ital">HNE</span> is also greater than the half of the segment of the circle about it, inasmuch as, if through the points <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span> we draw tangents to the circle and complete the parallelograms on the straight lines <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span>, each of the triangles <span class="ital">EKF</span>, <pb n="372"/><span class="ital">FLG</span>, <span class="ital">GMH</span>, <span class="ital">HNE</span> will be half of the parallelogram about it, while the segment about it is less than the parallelogram; hence each of the triangles <span class="ital">EKF</span>, <span class="ital">FLG</span>, <span class="ital">GMH</span>, <span class="ital">HNE</span> is greater than the half of the segment of the circle about it. </p>

<p>Thus, by bisecting the remaining circumferences and joining straight lines, and by doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the circle which will be less than the excess by which the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> exceeds the area <span class="ital">S</span>. </p>

<p>For it was proved in the first theorem of the tenth book that, if two unequal magnitudes be set out, and if from the greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than the half, and from that which is left a greater than the half, and if this be done continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out. </p>

<p>Let segments be left such as described, and let the segments of the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> on <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FL</span>, <span class="ital">LG</span>, <span class="ital">GM</span>, <span class="ital">MH</span>, <span class="ital">HN</span>, <span class="ital">NE</span> be less than the excess by which the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> exceeds the area <span class="ital">S</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the remainder, the polygon <span class="ital">EKFLGMHN</span>, is greater than the area <span class="ital">S</span>. </p>

<p>Let there be inscribed, also, in the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> the polygon <span class="ital">AOBPCQDR</span> similar to the polygon <span class="ital">EKFLGMHN</span>; therefore, as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is the polygon <span class="ital">AOBPCQDR</span> to the polygon <span class="ital">EKFLGMHN</span>. [<a href="/elem.12.1">XII. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, so also is the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> to the area <span class="ital">S</span>; therefore also, as the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is to the area <span class="ital">S</span>, so is the polygon <span class="ital">AOBPCQDR</span> to the polygon <span class="ital">EKFLGMHN</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] therefore, alternately, as the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is to the polygon inscribed in it, so is the area <span class="ital">S</span> to the polygon <span class="ital">EKFLGMHN</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is greater than the polygon inscribed in it; therefore the area <span class="ital">S</span> is also greater than the polygon <span class="ital">EKFLGMHN</span>. <pb n="373"/></p>

<p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is not the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> to any area less than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to any area less than the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> as the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that neither is the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> to any area greater than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater area <span class="ital">S</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, inversely, as the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>, so is the area <span class="ital">S</span> to the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the area <span class="ital">S</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to some area less than the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>; therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to some area less than the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>: [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] which was proved impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is not the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> to any area greater than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. </p>

<p>And it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to any area less than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>; therefore, as the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> to the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
<div id="elem.12.2.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>I say that, the area <span class="ital">S</span> being greater than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, as the area <span class="ital">S</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to some area less than the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>. </p>

       
<p>For let it be contrived that, as the area <span class="ital">S</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to the area <span class="ital">T</span>. </p>

       
<p>I say that the area <span class="ital">T</span> is less than the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>. </p>

       
<p>For since, as the area <span class="ital">S</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to the area <span class="ital">T</span>, <pb n="374"/>therefore, alternately, as the area <span class="ital">S</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> to the area <span class="ital">T</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

       
<p>But the area <span class="ital">S</span> is greater than the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span>; therefore the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is also greater than the area <span class="ital">T</span>. </p>

       
<p>Hence, as the area <span class="ital">S</span> is to the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, so is the circle <span class="ital">EFGH</span> to some area less than the circle <span class="ital">ABCD</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
