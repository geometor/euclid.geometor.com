<h1>Proposition 9.</h1>
<p><em>If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments</em>, <em>the squares on the unequal segments of the whole are double of the square on the half and of the square on the straight line between the points of section</em>.</p>

<p>For let a straight line <em>AB</em> be cut into equal segments at <em>C</em>, and into unequal segments at <em>D</em>;</p>

<p>I say that the squares on <em>AD</em>, <em>DB</em> are double of the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>CE</em> be drawn from <em>C</em> at right angles to <em>AB</em>, and let it be made equal to either <em>AC</em> or <em>CB</em>; let <em>EA</em>, <em>EB</em> be joined, let <em>DF</em> be drawn through <em>D</em> parallel to <em>EC</em>, and <em>FG</em> through <em>F</em> parallel to <em>AB</em>, and let <em>AF</em> be joined.</p>

<p>Then, since <em>AC</em> is equal to <em>CE</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>EAC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>AEC</em>.</span></p>

<p>And, since the angle at <em>C</em> is right, <span class="center">the remaining angles <em>EAC</em>, <em>AEC</em> are equal to one right angle. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>]</span></p>

<p>And they are equal; <span class="center">therefore each of the angles <em>CEA</em>, <em>CAE</em> is half a right angle.</span></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">each of the angles <em>CEB</em>, <em>EBC</em> is also half a right angle; therefore the whole angle <em>AEB</em> is right.</span></p>

<p>And, since the angle <em>GEF</em> is half a right angle, <pb n="393"/>and the angle <em>EGF</em> is right, for it is equal to the interior and opposite angle <em>ECB</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] <span class="center">the remaining angle <em>EFG</em> is half a right angle; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the angle <em>GEF</em> is equal to the angle <em>EFG</em>, so that the side <em>EG</em> is also equal to <em>GF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>]</span></p>

<p>Again, since the angle at <em>B</em> is half a right angle, and the angle <em>FDB</em> is right, for it is again equal to the interior and opposite angle <em>ECB</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] <span class="center">the remaining angle <em>BFD</em> is half a right angle; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the angle at <em>B</em> is equal to the angle <em>DFB</em>, so that the side <em>FD</em> is also equal to the side <em>DB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>]</span></p>

<p>Now, since <em>AC</em> is equal to <em>CE</em>, <span class="center">the square on <em>AC</em> is also equal to the square on <em>CE</em>; therefore the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CE</em> are double of the square on <em>AC</em>.</span></p>

<p>But the square on <em>EA</em> is equal to the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CE</em>, for the angle <em>ACE</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <span class="center">therefore the square on <em>EA</em> is double of the square on <em>AC</em>.</span></p>

<p>Again, since <em>EG</em> is equal to <em>GF</em>, <span class="center">the square on <em>EG</em> is also equal to the square on <em>GF</em>; therefore the squares on <em>EG</em>, <em>GF</em> are double of the square on <em>GF</em>.</span></p>

<p>But the square on <em>EF</em> is equal to the squares on <em>EG</em>, <em>GF</em>; <span class="center">therefore the square on <em>EF</em> is double of the square on <em>GF</em>.</span></p>

<p>But <em>GF</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore the square on <em>EF</em> is double of the square on <em>CD</em>.</p>

<p>But the square on <em>EA</em> is also double of the square on <em>AC</em>; <span class="center">therefore the squares on <em>AE</em>, <em>EF</em> are double of the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CD</em>.</span></p>

<p>And the square on <em>AF</em> is equal to the squares on <em>AE</em>, <em>EF</em>, for the angle <em>AEF</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the square on <em>AF</em> is double of the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CD</em>.</p>

<p>But the squares on <em>AD</em>, <em>DF</em> are equal to the square on <em>AF</em>, for the angle at <em>D</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the squares on <em>AD</em>, <em>DF</em> are double of the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CD</em>. <pb n="394"/></p>

<p>And <em>DF</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>; therefore the squares on <em>AD</em>, <em>DB</em> are double of the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CD</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
