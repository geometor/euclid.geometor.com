<p><emph>To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment</emph>.</p>

===

<h1>Proposition 11.</h1>
<p><em>To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment</em>.</p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut <em>AB</em> so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.</p>

<p>For let the square <em>ABDC</em> be described on <em>AB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] let <em>AC</em> be bisected at the point <em>E</em>, and let <em>BE</em> be joined; let <em>CA</em> be drawn through to <em>F</em>, and let <em>EF</em> be made equal to <em>BE</em>; let the square <em>FH</em> be described on <em>AF</em>, and let <em>GH</em> be drawn through to <em>K</em>. </p>

<p>I say that <em>AB</em> has been cut at <em>H</em> so as to make the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BH</em> equal to the square on <em>AH</em>.</p>

<p>For, since the straight line <em>AC</em> has been bisected at <em>E</em>, and <em>FA</em> is added to it, <span class="center">the rectangle contained by <em>CF</em>, <em>FA</em> together with the square on <em>AE</em> is equal to the square on <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>]</span></p>

<p>But <em>EF</em> is equal to <em>EB</em>; <span class="center">therefore the rectangle <em>CF</em>, <em>FA</em> together with the square on <em>AE</em> is equal to the square on <em>EB</em>.</span></p>

<p>But the squares on <em>BA</em>, <em>AE</em> are equal to the square on <em>EB</em>, for the angle at <em>A</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <span class="center">therefore the rectangle <em>CF</em>, <em>FA</em> together with the square on <em>AE</em> is equal to the squares on <em>BA</em>, <em>AE</em>.</span></p>

<p>Let the square on <em>AE</em> be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore the rectangle <em>CF</em>, <em>FA</em> which remains is equal to the square on <em>AB</em>.</span>
       <pb n="403"/></p>

<p>Now the rectangle <em>CF</em>, <em>FA</em> is <em>FK</em>, for <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FG</em>; and the square on <em>AB</em> is <em>AD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>FK</em> is equal to <em>AD</em>.</span></p>

<p>Let <em>AK</em> be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore <em>FH</em> which remains is equal to <em>HD</em>.</span></p>

<p>And <em>HD</em> is the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>BH</em>, for <em>AB</em> is equal to <em>BD</em>; and <em>FH</em> is the square on <em>AH</em>; <span class="center">therefore the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BH</em> is equal to the square on <em>HA</em>. therefore the given straight line <em>AB</em> has been cut at <em>H</em> so as to make the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BH</em> equal to the square on <em>HA</em>.
