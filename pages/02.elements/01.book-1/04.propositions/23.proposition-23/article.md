On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.

===

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line, <em>A</em> the point on it, and the angle <em>DCE</em> the given rectilineal angle;</p>


<p>thus it is required to construct on the given straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, a rectilineal angle equal to the given rectilineal angle <em>DCE</em>. </p>


<p>On the straight lines <em>CD</em>, <em>CE</em> respectively let the points <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> be taken at random; let <em>DE</em> be joined, and out of three straight lines which are equal to the three <pb n="295"/>straight lines <em>CD</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>CE</em> let the triangle <em>AFG</em> be constructed in such a way that <em>CD</em> is equal to <em>AF</em>, <em>CE</em> to <em>AG</em>, and further <em>DE</em> to <em>FG</em>.</p>


<p>Then, since the two sides <em>DC</em>, <em>CE</em> are equal to the two sides <em>FA</em>, <em>AG</em> respectively, <span class="center">and the base <em>DE</em> is equal to the base <em>FG</em>, the angle <em>DCE</em> is equal to the angle <em>FAG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span></p>


<p>Therefore on the given straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, the rectilineal angle <em>FAG</em> has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal angle <em>DCE</em>.</p>
