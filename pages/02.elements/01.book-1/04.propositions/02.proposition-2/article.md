To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.

===

<p>Let <em>A</em> be the given point, and <em>BC</em> the given straight line.</p>


<p>Thus it is required to place at the point <em>A</em> (as an extremity) <lb n="5"/>a straight line equal to the given straight line <em>BC</em>. </p>


<p>From the point <em>A</em> to the point <em>B</em> let the straight line <em>AB</em> be joined; [<a href="/elem.1.post.1">Post. 1</a>] and on it let the equilateral triangle <lb n="10"/><em>DAB</em> be constructed. [<a href="/elem.1.1">I. 1</a>]</p>


<p>Let the straight lines <em>AE</em>, <em>BF</em> be produced in a straight line with <em>DA</em>, <em>DB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.post.2">Post. 2</a>] with centre <em>B</em> and distance <em>BC</em> let the <lb n="15"/>circle <em>CGH</em> be described; [<a href="/elem.1.post.3">Post. 3</a>] and again, with centre <em>D</em> and distance <em>DG</em> let the circle <em>GKL</em> be described. [<a href="/elem.1.post.3">Post. 3</a>]</p>


<p>Then, since the point <em>B</em> is the centre of the circle <em>CGH</em>, <span class="center"><em>BC</em> is equal to <em>BG</em>.</span>
        <lb n="20"/></p>


<p>Again, since the point <em>D</em> is the centre of the circle <em>GKL</em>, <span class="center"><em>DL</em> is equal to <em>DG</em>.</span></p>


<p>And in these <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>; <span class="center">therefore the remainder <em>AL</em> is equal to the remainder <em>BG.</em> [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C.N. 3</a>]</span>
        <lb n="25"/></p>


<p>But <em>BC</em> was also proved equal to <em>BG</em>; <span class="center">therefore each of the straight lines <em>AL</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>BG</em>.</span></p>


<p>And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>] <lb n="30"/><span class="center">therefore <em>AL</em> is also equal to <em>BC</em>.</span></p>


<p>Therefore at the given point <em>A</em> the straight line <em>AL</em> is placed equal to the given straight line <em>BC</em>.</p>

<p>I have inserted these words because <quote>to place a straight line <em>at</em> a given point</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τῷ δοθέντι σημείῳ</foreign>) is not quite clear enough, at least in English.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in this first application of <a href="/elem.1.post.2">Postulate 2</a>, and again in <a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>, Euclid speaks of the <em>continuation</em> of the straight line as that which is produced in such cases, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκβεβλήσθωσαν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προσεκβεβλήσθωσαν</foreign> meaning little more than <em>drawing</em> straight lines <quote>in a straight line with</quote>
 the given straight lines. The first place in which Euclid uses phraseology exactly corresponding to ours when <pb n="245"/>speaking of a straight line being produced is in <a href="/elem.1.16">I. 16</a>: <quote>let one side of it, <em>BC</em>, be produced to <em>D</em></quote>

<blockquote n="23. the remainder AL...the remainder BG." class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

<p>The Greek expressions are <foreign lang="greek">λοιπὴ ἡ ΑΛ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λοιπῇ τῇ</foreign> BH, and the literal translation would be <quote><em>AL</em> (or <em>BG</em>) <em>remaining</em>,</quote>
 but the shade of meaning conveyed by the position of the definite article can hardly be expressed in English.</p>
