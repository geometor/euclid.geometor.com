Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

===

Let each of the straight lines `AB`, `CD` be parallel to `EF`; I say that `AB` is also parallel to `CD`. <lb n="5"/>

For let the straight line `GK` fall upon them; 

Then, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `AB`, `EF`, <lb n="10"/>

- the angle `AGK` is equal to the angle `GHF`. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]

Again, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `EF`, `CD`, 

- the angle `GHF` is equal to the angle `GKD`. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]

<!-- <lb n="15"/> -->

But the angle `AGK` was also proved equal to the angle `GHF`; 

- therefore the angle `AGK` is also equal to the angle `GKD`; [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]

and they are alternate. 
<!-- <lb n="20"/> -->

Therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`. [^1]

- Q. E. D.

[^1]: The usual <em>conclusion</em> in general terms (<quote>Therefore etc.</quote>) repeating the enunciation is, curiously enough, wanting at the end of this proposition.
