Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

===

<p>Let each of the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> be parallel to <em>EF</em>; I say that <em>AB</em> is also parallel to <em>CD</em>. <lb n="5"/></p>


<p>For let the straight line <em>GK</em> fall upon them; </p>


<p>Then, since the straight line <em>GK</em> has fallen on the parallel straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>EF</em>, <lb n="10"/><span class="center">the angle <em>AGK</em> is equal to the angle <em>GHF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span></p>


<p>Again, since the straight line <em>GK</em> has fallen on the parallel straight lines <em>EF</em>, <em>CD</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>GHF</em> is equal to the angle <em>GKD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span>
<lb n="15"/></p>


<p>But the angle <em>AGK</em> was also proved equal to the angle <em>GHF</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>AGK</em> is also equal to the angle <em>GKD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]</span> and they are alternate. <lb n="20"/></p>


<p>Therefore <em>AB</em> is parallel to <em>CD</em>.</p>
