<h1>Proposition 48.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>For in the triangle <em>ABC</em> let the square on one side <em>BC</em> be equal to the squares on the sides <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>;</p>

       
<p>I say that the angle <em>BAC</em> is right.</p>

       
<p>For let <em>AD</em> be drawn from the point <em>A</em> at right angles to the straight line <em>AC</em>, let <em>AD</em> be made equal to <em>BA</em>, and let <em>DC</em> be joined.</p>

       
<p>Since <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>, the square on <em>DA</em> is also equal to the square on <em>AB</em>. </p>

       
<p>Let the square on <em>AC</em> be added to each; <pb n="369"/><span class="center">therefore the squares on <em>DA</em>, <em>AC</em> are equal to the squares on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>But the square on <em>DC</em> is equal to the squares on <em>DA</em>, <em>AC</em>, for the angle <em>DAC</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] and the square on <em>BC</em> is equal to the squares on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>, for this is the hypothesis; <span class="center">therefore the square on <em>DC</em> is equal to the square on <em>BC</em>, so that the side <em>DC</em> is also equal to <em>BC</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>And, since <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>, and <em>AC</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>DA</em>, <em>AC</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>;</span> and the base <em>DC</em> is equal to the base <em>BC</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>DAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>BAC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span> But the angle <em>DAC</em> is right; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAC</em> is also right.</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>
