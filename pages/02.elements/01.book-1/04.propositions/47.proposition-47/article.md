<h1>Proposition 47.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <lb n="5"/><em>BAC</em> right;</p>

       
<p>I say that the square on <em>BC</em> is equal to the squares on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>.</p>

       
<p>For let there be described on <em>BC</em> the square <em>BDEC</em>, <lb n="10"/>and on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em> the squares <em>GB</em>, <em>HC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] through <em>A</em> let <em>AL</em> be drawn parallel to either <em>BD</em> or <em>CE</em>, and let <em>AD</em>, <em>FC</em> be joined. 
        <lb n="15"/></p>

       
<p>Then, since each of the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>BAG</em> is right, it follows that with a straight line <em>BA</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, the two straight lines <lb n="20"/><em>AC</em>, <em>AG</em> not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; <span class="center">therefore <em>CA</em> is in a straight line with <em>AG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.14">I. 14</a>]</span>
        <lb n="25"/></p>

       
<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>BA</em> is also in a straight line with <em>AH</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>And, since the angle <em>DBC</em> is equal to the angle <em>FBA</em>: for each is right: let the angle <em>ABC</em> be added to each; <lb n="30"/><span class="center">therefore the whole angle <em>DBA</em> is equal to the whole angle <em>FBC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]</span>
        <pb n="350"/></p>

       
<p>And, since <em>DB</em> is equal to <em>BC</em>, and <em>FB</em> to <em>BA</em>, the two sides <em>AB</em>, <em>BD</em> are equal to the two sides <em>FB</em>, <em>BC</em> respectively, <lb n="35"/><span class="center">and the angle <em>ABD</em> is equal to the angle <em>FBC</em>; therefore the base <em>AD</em> is equal to the base <em>FC</em>, and the triangle <em>ABD</em> is equal to the triangle <em>FBC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span></p>

       
<p>Now the parallelogram <em>BL</em> is double of the triangle <em>ABD</em>, for they have the same base <em>BD</em> and are in the same parallels <lb n="40"/><em>BD</em>, <em>AL</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.41">I. 41</a>]</p>

       
<p>And the square <em>GB</em> is double of the triangle <em>FBC</em>, for they again have the same base <em>FB</em> and are in the same parallels <em>FB</em>, <em>GC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.41">I. 41</a>]</p>

       
<p>[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.] <lb n="45"/><span class="center">Therefore the parallelogram <em>BL</em> is also equal to the square <em>GB</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>Similarly, if <em>AE</em>, <em>BK</em> be joined, the parallelogram <em>CL</em> can also be proved equal to the square <em>HC</em>; <lb n="50"/><span class="center">therefore the whole square <em>BDEC</em> is equal to the two squares <em>GB</em>, <em>HC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]</span></p>

       
<p>And the square <em>BDEC</em> is described on <em>BC</em>, <span class="center">and the squares <em>GB</em>, <em>HC</em> on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>.</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore the square on the side <em>BC</em> is equal to the <lb n="55"/>squares on the sides <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>.</p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>
