Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels.

===

Let `ABC`, `DBC` be equal triangles which are on the same base `BC` and on the same side of it; <lb n="5"/>[I say that they are also in the same parallels.]

And [For] let `AD` be joined; I say that `AD` is parallel to `BC`.

For, if not, let `AE` be drawn through the point `A` parallel to the straight line <lb n="10"/>`BC`, [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] and let `EC` be joined. 

Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `EBC`; for it is on the same base `BC` with it and in the same <lb n="15"/>parallels. [<a href="/elem.1.37">I. 37</a>]

But `ABC` is equal to `DBC`; 

- therefore `DBC` is also equal to `EBC`, [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>] the greater to the less: which is impossible.

Therefore `AE` is not parallel to `BC`. <lb n="20"/>

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `AD`; 

- therefore `AD` is parallel to `BC`.

Therefore etc.

       [<span class="bold">I say that they are also in the same parallels.</span>] Heiberg has proved (<title>Hermes</title>, XXXVIII., 1903, p. 50) from a recently discovered papyrus-fragment (<title>Fayūm towns and their papyri</title>, p. 96, No. IX.) that these words are an interpolation by some one who did not observe that the words <quote>And let `AD` be joined</quote>
       are part of the <em>setting-out</em> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔκθεσις</foreign>), but took them as belonging to the <em>construction</em> (<foreign lang="greek">κατασκευή</foreign>) and consequently thought that a <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> or <quote>definition</quote>
       (of the thing to be proved) should precede. The interpolator then altered <quote>And</quote>
       into <quote>For</quote>
       in the next sentence.
