If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.

===

<p>For let the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> cut one another at the point <em>E</em>; <lb n="5"/></p>


<p>I say that the angle <em>AEC</em> is equal to the angle <em>DEB</em>, <span class="center">and the angle <em>CEB</em> to the angle <em>AED</em>.</span>
</p>


<p>For, since the straight line <em>AE</em> stands <lb n="10"/>on the straight line <em>CD</em>, making the angles <em>CEA</em>, <em>AED</em>, <span class="center">the angles <em>CEA</em>, <em>AED</em> are equal to two right angles [<a href="/elem.1.13">I. 13</a>]</span>
<pb n="278"/></p>


<p>Again, since the straight line <em>DE</em> stands on the straight line <em>AB</em>, making the angles <em>AED</em>, <em>DEB</em>, <span class="center">the angles <em>AED</em>, <em>DEB</em> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.13">I. 13</a>]</span>
<lb n="15"/></p>


<p>But the angles <em>CEA</em>, <em>AED</em> were also proved equal to two right angles; <span class="center">therefore the angles <em>CEA</em>, <em>AED</em> are equal to the angles <em>AED</em>
<em>DEB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.post.4">Post. 4</a> and <a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C. N. 1</a>] Let the angle <em>AED</em> be subtracted from each; <lb n="20"/>therefore the remaining angle <em>CEA</em> is equal to the remaining angle <em>BED</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C. N. 3</a>]</span></p>


<p>Similarly it can be proved that the angles <em>CEB</em>, <em>DEA</em> are also equal.</p>


<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D. <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>[From this it is manifest that, if two straight lines cut one another, they will make the angles at the point of section equal to four right angles.</p>

<p>The difference between <em>adjacent</em> angles (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ ἐφεξῆς γωνίαι</foreign>) and <em>vertical</em> angles (<foreign lang="greek">αἱ κατὰ κορυφὴν γωνίαι</foreign>) is thus explained by Proclus (<xref n="Proc. p. 298, 14-24" from="ROOT" to="DITTO">p. 298, 14-24</xref>). The first term describes the angles made by two straight lines when one only is divded by the other, i.e. when one straight line meets another at a point which is not either of its extremities, but is not itself produced beyond the point of meeting. When the first straight line <em>is</em> produced, so that the lines cross at the point, they make two pairs of <em>vertical</em> angles (which are more clearly described as <em>vertically opposite</em> angles), and which are so called because their convergence is from opposite directions to one point (the intersection of the lines) as vertex (<foreign lang="greek">κορυφή</foreign>).</p>
