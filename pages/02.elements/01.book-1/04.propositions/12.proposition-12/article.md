To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

===

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given infinite straight line, and <em>C</em> the given point which is not on it; <pb n="271"/><lb n="5"/>thus it is required to draw to the given infinite straight line <em>AB</em>, from the given point <em>C</em> which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.</p>


<p>For let a point <em>D</em> be taken <lb n="10"/>at random on the other side of the straight line <em>AB</em>, and with centre <em>C</em> and distance <em>CD</em> let the circle <em>EFG</em> be described; [<a href="/elem.1.post.3">Post. 3</a>] 
<span class="center">let the straight line <em>EG</em>
<lb n="15"/>be bisected at <em>H</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.10">I. 10</a>] and let the straight lines <em>CG</em>, <em>CH</em>, <em>CE</em> be joined. [<a href="/elem.1.post.1">Post. 1</a>]</span></p>


<p>I say that <em>CH</em> has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line <em>AB</em> from the given point <em>C</em> which is not on it. <lb n="20"/></p>


<p>For, since <em>GH</em> is equal to <em>HE</em>, and <em>HC</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>GH</em>, <em>HC</em> are equal to the two sides <em>EH</em>, <em>HC</em> respectively;</span> and the base <em>CG</em> is equal to the base <em>CE</em>; <lb n="25"/><span class="center">therefore the angle <em>CHG</em> is equal to the angle <em>EHC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] And they are adjacent angles.</span></p>


<p>But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is <lb n="30"/>called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">Def. 10</a>]</p>


<p>Therefore <em>CH</em> has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line <em>AB</em> from the given point <em>C</em> which is not on it.</p>
