To bisect a given rectilineal angle.


===

<p>Let the angle `BAC` be the given rectilineal angle.</p>


<p>Thus it is required to bisect it.</p>


<p>Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AB`; let `AE` be cut off from `AC` equal to `AD`; [<a href="/elem.1.3">I. 3</a>] let `DE` be joined, and on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `DEF` be constructed; let `AF` be joined. </p>


<p>I say that the angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.</p>


<p>For, since `AD` is equal to `AE`, and `AF` is common, <span class="center">the two sides `DA`, `AF` are equal to the two sides `EA`, `AF` respectively.</span></p>


<p>And the base `DF` is equal to the base `EF`; <span class="center">therefore the angle `DAF` is equal to the angle `EAF`. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span></p>


<p>Therefore the given rectilineal angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.</p>
