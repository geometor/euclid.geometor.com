On a given straight line to describe a square.

===

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line <em>AB</em>.
<lb n="5"/></p>


<p>Let <em>AC</em> be drawn at right angles to the straight line <em>AB</em> from the point <em>A</em> on it [<a href="/elem.1.11">I. 11</a>], and let <em>AD</em> be made equal to <em>AB</em>; through the point <em>D</em> let <em>DE</em> be drawn <lb n="10"/>parallel to <em>AB</em>, and through the point <em>B</em> let <em>BE</em> be drawn parallel to <em>AD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] <pb n="348"/></p>


<p>Therefore <em>ADEB</em> is a parallelogram; <span class="center">therefore <em>AB</em> is equal to <em>DE</em>, and <em>AD</em> to <em>BE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span></p>


<p>But <em>AB</em> is equal to <em>AD</em>; <lb n="15"/><span class="center">therefore the four straight lines <em>BA</em>, <em>AD</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em> are equal to one another;</span> therefore the parallelogram <em>ADEB</em> is equilateral.</p>


<p>I say next that it is also right-angled.</p>


<p>For, since the straight line <em>AD</em> falls upon the parallels <lb n="20"/><em>AB</em>, <em>DE</em>, <span class="center">the angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>ADE</em> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span></p>


<p>But the angle <em>BAD</em> is right; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>ADE</em> is also right.</span></p>


<p>And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and <lb n="25"/>angles are equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] <span class="center">therefore each of the opposite angles <em>ABE</em>, <em>BED</em> is also right. Therefore <em>ADEB</em> is right-angled.</span></p>


<p>And it was also proved equilateral. <lb n="30"/></p>


<p>Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line <em>AB</em>.</p>

<p>Proclus (<xref n="Proc. p. 423, 18" from="ROOT" to="DITTO">p. 423, 18 sqq.</xref>) blockquotes the difference between the word <em>construct</em> (<foreign lang="greek">συστἡσασθαι</foreign>) applied by Euclid to the construction of a <em>triangle</em> (and, he might have added, of an <em>angle</em>) and the words <em>describe on</em> (<foreign lang="greek">ἀναγράφειν ἀπό</foreign>) used of drawing a square on a given straight line as one side. The <em>triangle</em> (or <em>angle</em>) is, so to say, pieced together, while the describing of a square on a given straight line is the making of a figure <quote>from</quote>
 <em>one</em> side, and corresponds to the multiplication of the number representing the side by itself.</p>
