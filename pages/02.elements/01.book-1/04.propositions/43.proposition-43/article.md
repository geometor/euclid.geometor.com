In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.

===

Let `ABCD` be a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter; and about `AC` let `EH`, `FG` be parallelograms, and `BK`, `KD`
<lb n="5"/>the so-called complements;

I say that the complement `BK` is equal to the complement `KD`.

For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter, 

- the triangle `ABC` is equal to <lb n="10"/>the triangle `ACD`. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]

Again, since `EH` is a parallelogram, and `AK` is its diameter, 

- the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`.

<lb n="15"/>For the same reason 

- the triangle `KFC` is also equal to `KGC`.

Now, since the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`, 

- and `KFC` to `KGC`,

<lb n="20"/>the triangle `AEK` together with `KGC` is equal to the triangle `AHK` together with `KFC`. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]

And the whole triangle `ABC` is also equal to the whole `ADC`; therefore the complement `BK` which remains is equal to the <lb n="25"/>complement `KD` which remains. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C.N. 3</a>]

Therefore etc.
