To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.

===

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given triangle, and <em>D</em> the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to construct in the rectilineal angle <em>D</em> a parallelogram equal to the triangle <em>ABC</em>. </p>


<p>Let <em>BC</em> be bisected at <em>E</em>, and let <em>AE</em> be joined; on the straight line <em>EC</em>, and at the point <em>E</em> on it, let the angle <em>CEF</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>D</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] through <em>A</em> let <em>AG</em> be drawn parallel to <em>EC</em>, and [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] through <em>C</em> let <em>CG</em> be drawn parallel to <em>EF</em>.</p>


<p>Then <em>FECG</em> is a parallelogram.</p>


<p>And, since <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>EC</em>, <span class="center">the triangle <em>ABE</em> is also equal to the triangle <em>AEC</em>, for they are on equal bases <em>BE</em>, <em>EC</em> and in the same parallels <em>BC</em>, <em>AG</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.38">I. 38</a>] therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is double of the triangle <em>AEC</em>.</span>

<p>But the parallelogram <em>FECG</em> is also double of the triangle <em>AEC</em>, for it has the same base with it and is in the same parallels with it; [<a href="/elem.1.41">I. 41</a>] <span class="center">therefore the parallelogram <em>FECG</em> is equal to the triangle <em>ABC</em>.</span></p>


<p>And it has the angle <em>CEF</em> equal to the given angle <em>D</em>.</p>


<p>Therefore the parallelogram <em>FECG</em> has been constructed equal to the given triangle <em>ABC</em>, in the angle <em>CEF</em> which is equal to <em>D</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
