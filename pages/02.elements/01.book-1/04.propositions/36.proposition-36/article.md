Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

===

Let `ABCD`, `EFGH` be parallelograms which are on equal bases `BC`, `FG` and in the same parallels `AH`, `BG`;  I say that the parallelogram `ABCD` is equal to `EFGH`.

For let `BE`, `CH` be joined.

Then, since `BC` is equal to `FG` while `FG` is equal to `EH`, 

- `BC` is also equal to `EH`. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]

But they are also parallel.

And `EB`, `HC` join them; but straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are equal and parallel. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>]

Therefore `EBCH` is a parallelogram. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]

And it is equal to `ABCD`; for it has the same base `BC` with it, and is in the same parallels `BC`, `AH` with it. [<a href="/elem.1.35">I. 35</a>]

For the same reason also `EFGH` is equal to the same `EBCH`; [<a href="/elem.1.35">I. 35</a>] so that the parallelogram `ABCD` is also equal to `EFGH`. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]

Therefore etc.
