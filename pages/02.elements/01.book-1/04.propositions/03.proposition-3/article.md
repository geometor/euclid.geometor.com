Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a straight line equal to the less.


===

<div class="Proof">

<p>Let <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em> be the-two given unequal straight lines, and let <em>AB</em> be the greater of them.</p>


<p>Thus it is required to cut off from <em>AB</em> the greater a straight line equal to <em>C</em> the less.</p>


<p>At the point <em>A</em> let <em>AD</em> be placed equal to the straight line <em>C</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.2">I. 2</a>] and with centre <em>A</em> and distance <em>AD</em> let the circle <em>DEF</em> be described. [<a href="/elem.1.post.3">Post. 3</a>] <pb n="247"/><span class="center">Now, since the point <em>A</em> is the centre of the circle <em>DEF</em>, <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>AD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.def.15">Def. 15</a>] But <em>C</em> is also equal to <em>AD</em>. Therefore each of the straight lines <em>AE</em>, <em>C</em> is equal to <em>AD</em>; so that <em>AE</em> is also equal to <em>C</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]</span></p>


<p>Therefore, given the two straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em>, from <em>AB</em> the greater <em>AE</em> has been cut off equal to <em>C</em> the less.</p>

<p>(Being) what it was required to do.</p>
