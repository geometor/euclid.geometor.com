Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels

===

Let `ABC`, `CDE` be equal triangles on equal bases `BC`, `CE` and on the same side.

I say that they are also in the same parallels.

For let `AD` be joined; I say that `AD` is parallel to `BE`.

For, if not, let `AF` be drawn through `A` parallel to `BE` [1.31], and let `FE` be joined. 

Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `FCE`; for they are on equal bases `BC`, `CE` and in the same parallels `BE`, `AF`. [1.38]

But the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DCE`; 

- therefore the triangle `DCE` is also equal to the triangle `FCE`, [1.c.n.1] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore `AF` is not parallel to `BE`.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `AD`; 

- therefore `AD` is parallel to `BE`.

Therefore etc. 

- Q. E. D.
