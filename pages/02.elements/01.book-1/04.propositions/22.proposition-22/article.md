Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>]

===

<p>Let the three given straight lines be <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and of these let two taken together in any manner be greater than the remaining one, namely <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> greater than <em>C</em>, <span class="center"><em>A</em>, <em>C</em> greater than <em>B</em>,</span> and <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> greater than <em>A</em>; thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>. </p>


<p>Let there be set out a straight line <em>DE</em>, terminated at <em>D</em> but of infinite length in the direction of <em>E</em>, and let <em>DF</em> be made equal to <em>A</em>, <em>FG</em> equal to <em>B</em>, and <em>GH</em> equal to <em>C</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.3">I. 3</a>]</p>


<p>With centre <em>F</em> and distance <em>FD</em> let the circle <em>DKL</em> be described; again, with centre <em>G</em> and distance <em>GH</em> let the circle <em>KLH</em> be described; and let <em>KF</em>, <em>KG</em> be joined;</p>


<p>I say that the triangle <em>KFG</em> has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>. <pb n="293"/></p>


<p>For, since the point <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle <em>DKL</em>, <span class="center"><em>FD</em> is equal to <em>FK</em>.</span></p>


<p>But <em>FD</em> is equal to <em>A</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>KF</em> is also equal to <em>A</em>.</span></p>


<p>Again, since the point <em>G</em> is the centre of the circle <em>LKH</em>, <span class="center"><em>GH</em> is equal to <em>GK</em>.</span></p>


<p>But <em>GH</em> is equal to <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>KG</em> is also equal to <em>C</em>. And <em>FG</em> is also equal to <em>B</em>;</span> therefore the three straight lines <em>KF</em>, <em>FG</em>, <em>GK</em> are equal to the three straight lines <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>.</p>


<p>Therefore out of the three straight lines <em>KF</em>, <em>FG</em>, <em>GK</em>, which are equal to the three given straight lines <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, the triangle <em>KFG</em> has been constructed.</p>

<p>This is the first case in the <title>Elements</title> of a <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> to a problem in the sense of a statement of the conditions or limits of the possibility of a solution. The criterion is of course supplied by the preceding proposition.</p>

<p>This is usually translated (e.g. by Williamson and Simson) <quote><title>But</title> it is necessary,</quote>
 which is however inaccurate, since the Greek is not <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δέ</foreign> but <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δή</foreign>. The words are the same as those used to introduce the <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> in the other sense of the <quote>definition</quote>
 or <quote>particular statement</quote>
 of a construction to be effected. Hence, as in the latter case we say <quote>thus it is required</quote>
 (e.g. to bisect the finite straight line <em>AB</em>, <a href="/elem.1.10">I. 10</a>), we should here translate <quote><em>thus</em> it is necessary.</quote>
</p>

      </blockquote><blockquote n="4" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       
<p>To this enunciation all the MSS. and Boethius add, after the <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign>, the words <quote>because in any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.</quote>
 But this explanation has the appearance of a gloss, and it is omitted by Proclus and Campanus. Moreover there is no corresponding addition to the <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> of <a href="/elem.6.28">VI. 28</a>.</p>
