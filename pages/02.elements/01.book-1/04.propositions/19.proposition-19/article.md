<p>In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.</p>

===

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a triangle having the angle <em>ABC</em> greater than the angle <em>BCA</em>;</p>


<p>I say that the side <em>AC</em> is also greater than the side <em>AB</em>.</p>


<p>For, if not, <em>AC</em> is either equal to <em>AB</em> or less.</p>


<p>Now <em>AC</em> is not equal to <em>AB</em>; for then the angle <em>ABC</em> would also have been equal to the angle <em>ACB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] but it is not; 
<span class="center">therefore <em>AC</em> is not equal to <em>AB</em>.</span></p>


<p>Neither is <em>AC</em> less than <em>AB</em>, for then the angle <em>ABC</em> would also have been less than the angle <em>ACB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.18">I. 18</a>] but it is not; <span class="center">therefore <em>AC</em> is not less than <em>AB</em>.</span></p>


<p>And it was proved that it is not equal either. <span class="center">Therefore <em>AC</em> is greater than <em>AB</em>.</span></p>


<p>Therefore etc.</p>
