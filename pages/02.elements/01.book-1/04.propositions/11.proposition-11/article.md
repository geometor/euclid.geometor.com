To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.


===

Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line, and <em>C</em> the given point on it. <lb n="5"/>

Thus it is required to draw from the point <em>C</em> a straight line at right angles to the straight line <em>AB</em>.

Let a point <em>D</em> be taken at random on <em>AC</em>; <lb n="10"/>let <em>CE</em> be made equal to <em>CD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.3">I. 3</a>] on <em>DE</em> let the equilateral triangle <em>FDE</em> be constructed, [<a href="/elem.1.1">I. 1</a>] and let <em>FC</em> be joined; 

I say that the straight line <em>FC</em> has been drawn at right <lb n="15"/>angles to the given straight line <em>AB</em> from <em>C</em> the given point on it.

For, since <em>DC</em> is equal to <em>CE</em>, and <em>CF</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>DC</em>, <em>CF</em> are equal to the two sides <em>EC</em>, <lb n="20"/><em>CF</em> respectively;</span> and the base <em>DF</em> is equal to the base <em>FE</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>DCF</em> is equal to the angle <em>ECF</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span> and they are adjacent angles.

But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes <lb n="25"/>the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">Def. 10</a>] <span class="center">therefore each of the angles <em>DCF</em>, <em>FCE</em> is right.</span>

Therefore the straight line <em>CF</em> has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line <em>AB</em> from the given point <lb n="30"/><em>C</em> on it.
