Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

===

Let <em>ABCD</em>, <em>EBCF</em> be parallelograms on the same base <em>BC</em> and in the same parallels <em>AF</em>, <em>BC</em>; <lb n="5"/>I say that <em>ABCD</em> is equal to the parallelogram <em>EBCF</em>.

For, since <em>ABCD</em> is a parallelogram, <span class="center"><em>AD</em> is equal to <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span>
<pb n="327"/>

For the same reason also <span class="center"><em>EF</em> is equal to <em>BC</em>, <lb n="10"/>so that <em>AD</em> is also equal to <em>EF</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]</span> and <em>DE</em> is common; <span class="center">therefore the whole <em>AE</em> is equal to the whole <em>DF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]</span>

But <em>AB</em> is also equal to <em>DC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore the two sides <em>EA</em>, <em>AB</em> are equal to the two sides <lb n="15"/><em>FD</em>, <em>DC</em> respectively,
<span class="center">and the angle <em>FDC</em> is equal to the angle <em>EAB</em>, the exterior to the interior; [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] therefore the base <em>EB</em> is equal <lb n="20"/>to the base <em>FC</em>, and the triangle <em>EAB</em> will be equal to the triangle <em>FDC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>

Let <em>DGE</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium <em>ABGD</em> which remains is equal to the trapezium <em>EGCF</em> which remains. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C.N. 3</a>] <lb n="25"/>

Let the triangle <em>GBC</em> be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is equal to the whole parallelogram <em>EBCF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]

Therefore etc.

<blockquote n="22. Let DGE be subtracted." class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

Euclid speaks of the triangle <em>DGE</em> without any explanation that, in the case which he takes (where <em>AD</em>, <em>EF</em> have no point in common), <em>BE</em>, <em>CD</em> must meet at a point <em>G</em> between the two parallels. He allows this to appear from the figure simply.
