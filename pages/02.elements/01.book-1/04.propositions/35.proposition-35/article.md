Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

===

Let `ABCD`, `EBCF` be parallelograms on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `AF`, `BC`; I say that `ABCD` is equal to the parallelogram `EBCF`.

For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, 

- `AD` is equal to `BC`. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]

For the same reason also 

- `EF` is equal to `BC`, so that `AD` is also equal to `EF`; [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]

and `DE` is common; 

- therefore the whole `AE` is equal to the whole `DF`. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]

But `AB` is also equal to `DC`; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore the two sides `EA`, `AB` are equal to the two sides `FD`, `DC` respectively,

- and the angle `FDC`[^1] is equal to the angle `EAB`, the exterior to the interior; [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] therefore the base `EB` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `EAB` will be equal to the triangle `FDC`. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]

Let `DGE` be subtracted [^2] from each; therefore the trapezium `ABGD` which remains is equal to the trapezium `EGCF` which remains. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C.N. 3</a>] 

Let the triangle `GBC` be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram `ABCD` is equal to the whole parallelogram `EBCF`. [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]

Therefore etc.

[^2]: DGE
    Euclid speaks of the triangle `DGE` without any explanation that, in the case which he takes (where `AD`, `EF` have no point in common), `BE`, `CD` must meet at a point `G` between the two parallels. He allows this to appear from the figure simply.
