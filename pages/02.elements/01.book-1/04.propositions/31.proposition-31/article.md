<h1>Proposition 31.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>Through a given point to draw a straight line parallel to a given straight line.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>A</em> be the given point, and <em>BC</em> the given straight line; thus it is required to draw through the point <em>A</em> a straight line parallel to the straight line <em>BC</em>. <pb n="316"/></p>

       
<p>Let a point <em>D</em> be taken at random on <em>BC</em>, and let <em>AD</em> be joined; on the straight line <em>DA</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, let the angle <em>DAE</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>ADC</em> [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>]; and let the straight line <em>AF</em> be produced in a straight line with <em>EA</em>. </p>

       
<p>Then, since the straight line <em>AD</em> falling on the two straight lines <em>BC</em>, <em>EF</em> has made the alternate angles <em>EAD</em>, <em>ADC</em> equal to one another, <span class="center">therefore <em>EAF</em> is parallel to <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.27">I. 27</a>]</span></p>

       
<p>Therefore through the given point <em>A</em> the straight line <em>EAF</em> has been drawn parallel to the given straight line <em>BC</em>.</p>
