Through a given point to draw a straight line parallel to a given straight line.

===

Let `A` be the given point, and `BC` the given straight line; thus it is required to draw through the point `A` a straight line parallel to the straight line `BC`. <pb n="316"/>

Let a point `D` be taken at random on `BC`, and let `AD` be joined; on the straight line `DA`, and at the point `A` on it, let the angle `DAE` be constructed equal to the angle `ADC` [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>]; and let the straight line `AF` be produced in a straight line with `EA`.

Then, since the straight line `AD` falling on the two straight lines `BC`, `EF` has made the alternate angles `EAD`, `ADC` equal to one another, 

- therefore `EAF` is parallel to `BC`. [<a href="/elem.1.27">I. 27</a>]

Therefore through the given point `A` the straight line `EAF` has been drawn parallel to the given straight line `BC`.
