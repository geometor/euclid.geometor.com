<pb n="332"/><h1>Proposition 37.</h1><div class="Enunc">
       
<p>Triangles which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.</p>

      </div><div class="Proof">
       
<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DBC</em> be triangles on the same base <em>BC</em> and in the same parallels <em>AD</em>, <em>BC</em>; <lb n="5"/>I say that the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>DBC</em>.</p>

       
<p>Let <em>AD</em> be produced in both directions to <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>; through <em>B</em> let <em>BE</em> be drawn parallel to <em>CA</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] <lb n="10"/>and through <em>C</em> let <em>CF</em> be drawn parallel to <em>BD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

       
<p>Then each of the figures <em>EBCA</em>, <em>DBCF</em> is a parallelogram; and they are equal, <lb n="15"/></p>

       
<p>for they are on the same base <em>BC</em> and in the same parallels <em>BC</em>, <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.35">I. 35</a>]</p>

       
<p>Moreover the triangle <em>ABC</em> is half of the parallelogram <em>EBCA</em>; for the diameter <em>AB</em> bisects it. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</p>

       
<p>And the triangle <em>DBC</em> is half of the parallelogram <em>DBCF</em>; <lb n="20"/>for the diameter <em>DC</em> bisects it. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</p>

       
<p>[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]</p>

       
<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>DBC</em>.</p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>

<p>Q. E. D.</p>

      </div><blockquote n="21" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       
<p>Here and in the next proposition Heiberg brackets the words <quote>But the halves of equal things are equal to one another</quote>
 on the ground that, since the <title>Common Notion</title> which asserted this fact was interpolated at a very early date (before the time of Theon), it is probable that the words here were interpolated at the same time. Cf. blockquote above (p. 224) on the interpolated <title>Common Notion</title>.</p>
