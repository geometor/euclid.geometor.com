Triangles which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

===

Let `ABC`, `DBC` be triangles on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `AD`, `BC`; I say that the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DBC`.

Let `AD` be produced in both directions to `E`, `F`; through `B` let `BE` be drawn parallel to `CA`, [1.31] and through `C` let `CF` be drawn parallel to `BD`. [1.31] 

Then each of the figures `EBCA`, `DBCF` is a parallelogram; and they are equal, 

for they are on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `BC`, `EF`. [1.35]

Moreover the triangle `ABC` is half of the parallelogram `EBCA`; for the diameter `AB` bisects it. [1.34]

And the triangle `DBC` is half of the parallelogram `DBCF`; for the diameter `DC` bisects it. [1.34]

[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.] [^1]

Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DBC`.

Therefore etc.

[^1]: But the halves of equal things are equal to one another
    Here and in the next proposition Heiberg brackets the words <quote>But the halves of equal things are equal to one another</quote> on the ground that, since the <title>Common Notion</title> which asserted this fact was interpolated at a very early date (before the time of Theon), it is probable that the words here were interpolated at the same time. Cf. note above (p. 224) on the interpolated <title>Common Notion</title>.
