If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another. <lb n="5"/>

===

<p>For with any straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the point <em>B</em> on it, let the two straight lines <em>BC</em>, <em>BD</em> not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ABD</em> equal to two right angles;</p>


<p>I say that <em>BD</em> is in a straight line with <em>CB</em>. <lb n="10"/></p>


<p>For, if <em>BD</em> is not in a straight line with <em>BC</em>, let <em>BE</em> be in a straight line with <em>CB</em>.</p>


<p>Then, since the straight line <em>AB</em> stands on the straight line <em>CBE</em>, 
<lb n="15"/><span class="center">the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ABE</em> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.13">I. 13</a>]</span> But the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ABD</em> are also equal to two right angles; <span class="center">therefore the angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>ABE</em> are equal to the angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>ABD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.post.4">Post. 4</a> and <a href="/elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</a>]</span></p>


<p>Let the angle <em>CBA</em> be subtracted from each; <lb n="20"/>therefore the remaining angle <em>ABE</em> is equal to the remaining angle <em>ABD</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.c.n.3">C.N. 3</a>] <span class="center">the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore <em>BE</em> is not in a straight line with <em>CB</em>.</span></p>


<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight <lb n="25"/>line except <em>BD</em>. <pb n="277"/><span class="center">Therefore <em>CB</em> is in a straight line with <em>BD</em>.</span></p>


<p>Therefore etc.</p>

<p>There is no greater difficulty in translating the works of the Greek geometers than that of accurately giving the force of prepositions. <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign>, for instance, is used in all sorts of expressions with various shades of meaning. The present enunciation begins <foreign lang="greek">ἐὰν πρός τινι εὐθείᾳ καὶ τῷ πρὸς αὐτῆ σημείῳ</foreign>, and it is really necessary in this one sentence to translate <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign> by three different words, <em>with</em>, <em>at</em>, and <em>on</em>. The first <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign> must be translated by <em>with</em> because two straight lines <quote>make</quote>
 an angle <em>with</em> one another. On the other hand, where the similar expression <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τῇ δοθείση εὐθείᾳ</foreign> occurs in <a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>, but it is a question of <quote>constructing</quote>
 an angle (<foreign lang="greek">συστἡσασθαι</foreign>), we have to say <quote>to construct <em>on</em> a given straight line.</quote>
 <title>Against</title> would perhaps be the English word coming nearest to expressing all these meanings of <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign>, but it would be intolerable as a translation.</p>

<p>Todhunter points out that for the inference in this line <a href="/elem.1.post.4">Post. 4</a>, that all right angles are equal, is necessary as well as the Common Notion that things which are equal to the same thing (or rather, here, to <em>equal things</em>) are equal. A similar remark applies to steps in the proofs of <a href="/elem.1.15">I. 15</a> and <a href="/elem.1.28">I. 28</a>.</p>
