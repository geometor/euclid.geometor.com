To bisect a given finite straight line.

===

Let `AB` be the given finite straight line.

Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line `AB`.

Let the equilateral triangle `ABC` be constructed on it, [<a href="/elem.1.1">I. 1</a>] and let the angle `ACB` be bisected by the straight line `CD`; [<a href="/elem.1.9">I. 9</a>]

I say that the straight line `AB` has been bisected at the point `D`.

For, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common,

- the two sides `AC`, `CD` are equal to the two sides `BC`, `CD` respectively;

and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`;

- therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `BD`. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]

Therefore the given finite straight line `AB` has been bisected at `D`.
