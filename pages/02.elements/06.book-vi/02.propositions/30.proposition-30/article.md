<p><emph>To cut a given finite straight line in extreme and mean ratio</emph>. </p>

===

<h1>PROPOSITION 30.</h1>
<p><em>To cut a given finite straight line in extreme and mean ratio</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given finite straight line; <span class="center">thus it is required to cut <em>AB</em> in extreme and mean ratio.</span>
      </p>

<p>On <em>AB</em> let the square <em>BC</em> be described; and let there be applied to <em>AC</em> the parallelogram <em>CD</em> equal to <em>BC</em> and exceeding by the figure <em>AD</em> similar to <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.29">VI. 29</a>] </p>

<p>Now <em>BC</em> is a square; <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> is also a square.</span>
       
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>, let <em>CE</em> be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore the remainder <em>BF</em> is equal to the remainder <em>AD</em>.</span>
       <pb n="268"/></p>

<p>But it is also equiangular with it; therefore in <em>BF</em>, <em>AD</em> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; [<a href="/elem.6.14">VI. 14</a>] <span class="center">therefore, as <em>FE</em> is to <em>ED</em>, so is <em>AE</em> to <em>EB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>FE</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>, and <em>ED</em> to <em>AE</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AE</em>, so is <em>AE</em> to <em>EB</em>. </p>

<p>And <em>AB</em> is greater than <em>AE</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AE</em> is also greater than <em>EB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line <em>AB</em> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <em>E</em>, and the greater segment of it is <em>AE</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
