<pb n="257"/><h1>PROPOSITION 27.</h1>
<p><em>Of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to that described on the half of the straight line</em>, <em>that parallelogram is greatest which is applied to the half of the straight line and is similar to the defect</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be a straight line and let it be bisected at <em>C</em>; let there be applied to the straight line <em>AB</em> the parallelogram <em>AD</em> deficient by the parallelogrammic figure <em>DB</em> described on the half of <em>AB</em>, that is, <em>CB</em>;  I say that, of all the parallelograms applied to <em>AB</em> and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to <em>DB</em>, <em>AD</em> is greatest. </p>

<p>For let there be applied to the straight line <em>AB</em> the parallelogram <em>AF</em> deficient by the parallelogrammic figure <em>FB</em> similar and similarly situated to <em>DB</em>; I say that <em>AD</em> is greater than <em>AF</em>. </p>

<p>For, since the parallelogram <em>DB</em> is similar to the parallelogram <em>FB</em>, <span class="center">they are about the same diameter. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Let their diameter <em>DB</em> be drawn, and let the figure be described. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>CF</em> is equal to <em>FE</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.43">I. 43</a>] and <em>FB</em> is common, therefore the whole <em>CH</em> is equal to the whole <em>KE</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>CH</em> is equal to <em>CG</em>, since <em>AC</em> is also equal to <em>CB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.36">I. 36</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <em>GC</em> is also equal to <em>EK</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>CF</em> be added to each; <span class="center">therefore the whole <em>AF</em> is equal to the gnomon <em>LMN</em>;</span> so that the parallelogram <em>DB</em>, that is, <em>AD</em>, is greater than the parallelogram <em>AF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
