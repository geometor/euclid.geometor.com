<p><emph>To two given straight lines to find a mean proportional</emph>. </p>

===

<h1>PROPOSITION 13.</h1>
<p><em>To two given straight lines to find a mean proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> be the two given straight lines; thus it is required to find a mean proportional to <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>. </p>

<p>Let them be placed in a straight line, and let the semicircle <em>ADC</em> be described on <em>AC</em>;  let <em>BD</em> be drawn from the point <em>B</em> at right angles to the straight line <em>AC</em>, and let <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Since the angle <em>ADC</em> is an angle in a semicircle, it is right. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] </p>

<p>And, since, in the right-angled triangle <em>ADC</em>, <em>DB</em> has been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base, therefore <em>DB</em> is a mean proportional between the segments of the base, <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.8.p.1">VI. 8, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore to the two given straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> a mean proportional <em>DB</em> has been found. Q. E. F.</p>
