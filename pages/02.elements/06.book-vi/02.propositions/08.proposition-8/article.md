<h1>PROPOSITION 8.</h1>
<p><em>If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base</em>, <em>the triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to one another</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <em>BAC</em> right, and let <em>AD</em> be drawn from <em>A</em> perpendicular to <em>BC</em>; I say that each of the triangles <em>ABD</em>, <em>ADC</em> is similar to the whole <em>ABC</em> and, further, they are similar to one another. <pb n="210"/></p>

<p>For, since the angle <em>BAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>ADB</em>, for each is right, and the angle at <em>B</em> is common to the two triangles <em>ABC</em> and <em>ABD</em>, therefore the remaining angle <em>ACB</em> is equal to the remaining angle <em>BAD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>]  therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>ABD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>BC</em> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <em>ABC</em> is to <em>BA</em> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <em>ABD</em>, so is <em>AB</em> itself which subtends the angle at <em>C</em> in the triangle <em>ABC</em> to <em>BD</em> which subtends the equal angle <em>BAD</em> in the triangle <em>ABD</em>, and so also is <em>AC</em> to <em>AD</em> which subtends the angle at <em>B</em> common to the two triangles. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is both equiangular to the triangle <em>ABD</em> and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is similar to the triangle <em>ABD</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <em>ABC</em> is also similar to the triangle <em>ADC</em>; therefore each of the triangles <em>ABD</em>, <em>ADC</em> is similar to the whole <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>I say next that the triangles <em>ABD</em>, <em>ADC</em> are also similar to one another. </p>

<p>For, since the right angle <em>BDA</em> is equal to the right angle <em>ADC</em>, and moreover the angle <em>BAD</em> was also proved equal to the angle at <em>C</em>, therefore the remaining angle at <em>B</em> is also equal to the remaining angle <em>DAC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <em>ABD</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>ADC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>BD</em> which subtends the angle <em>BAD</em> in the triangle <em>ABD</em> is to <em>DA</em> which subtends the angle at <em>C</em> in the triangle <em>ADC</em> equal to the angle <em>BAD</em>, so is <em>AD</em> itself which subtends the angle at <em>B</em> in the triangle <em>ABD</em> to <em>DC</em> which subtends the angle <em>DAC</em> in the triangle <em>ADC</em> equal <pb n="211"/>to the angle at <em>B</em>, and so also is <em>BA</em> to <em>AC</em>, these sides subtending the right angles; [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] therefore the triangle <em>ABD</em> is similar to the triangle <em>ADC</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. </p>

<p>From this it is clear that, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base, the straight line so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the base. Q. E. D.</p>
