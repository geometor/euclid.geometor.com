       <hi rend="ital">Given three numbers, to find the least number which they measure.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Given three numbers, to find the least number which they measure.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the three given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">D</span>, the least number measured by the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, be taken. [<a href="/elem.7.34">VII. 34</a>] </p>

<p>Then <span class="ital">C</span> either measures, or does not measure, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>First, let it measure it. <pb n="340"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also measure <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the least that they measure. </p>

<p>For, if not, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will measure some number which is less than <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Let them measure <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore also <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the least number measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will also measure <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> is the least number measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> will measure <span class="ital">E</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will not measure any number which is less than <span class="ital">D</span>; <span class="center">therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is the least that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, let <span class="ital">C</span> not measure <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">E</span>, the least number measured by <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, be taken. [<a href="/elem.7.34">VII. 34</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore also <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore also <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the least that they measure. </p>

<p>For, if not, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will measure some number which is less than <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Let them measure <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">F</span>, therefore also <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore the least number measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will also measure <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> is the least number measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">F</span>, so that the least number measured by <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will also measure <span class="ital">F</span>. <pb n="341"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span> is the least number measured by <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">F</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will not measure any number which is less than <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is the least that is measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
