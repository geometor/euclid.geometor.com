<h1>PROPOSITION 35.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers measure any number, the least number measured by them will also measure the same.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure any number <span class="ital">CD</span>, and let <span class="ital">E</span> be the least that they measure; I say that <span class="ital">E</span> also measures <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">E</span> does not measure <span class="ital">CD</span>, let <span class="ital">E</span>, measuring <span class="ital">DF</span>, leave <span class="ital">CF</span> less than itself. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">E</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will also measure <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>But they also measure the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore they will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">CF</span> which is less than <span class="ital">E</span>: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span> cannot fail to measure <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore it measures it. Q. E. D.</p>
