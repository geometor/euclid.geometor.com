<h1>PROPOSITION 34.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Given two numbers, to find the least number which they measure.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be the two given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are either prime to one another or not. 
      </p>

<p>First, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be prime to one another, and let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore also <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">A</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">C</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the least number they measure. </p>

<p>For, if not, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will measure some number which is less than <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let them measure <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Then, as many times as <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">E</span>, and, as many times as <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span>
       <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>, as consequent consequent. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">D</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. <pb n="337"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> do not measure any number less than <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is the least that is measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> not be prime to one another, and let <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a>] therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore also <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> measure <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the least number that they measure. </p>

<p>For, if not, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will measure some number which is less than <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let them measure <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">G</span>, and, as many times as <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">G</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">H</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <span class="ital">F</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are least, and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">G</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">D</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. <pb n="338"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will not measure any number which is less than <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is the least that is measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
