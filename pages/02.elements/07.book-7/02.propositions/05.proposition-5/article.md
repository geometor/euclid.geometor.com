<h1>PROPOSITION 5.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number be a part of a number, and another be the same part of another, the sum will also be the same part of the sum that the one is of the one.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> be a part of <span class="ital">BC</span>, and another, <span class="ital">D</span>, the same part of another <span class="ital">EF</span> that <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">BC</span>; I say that the sum of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is also the same part of the sum of <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> that <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>For since, whatever part <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is also the same part of <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore, as many numbers as there are in <span class="ital">BC</span> equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, so many numbers are there also in <span class="ital">EF</span> equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">BC</span> be divded into the numbers equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, namely <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span>, and <span class="ital">EF</span> into the numbers equal to <span class="ital">D</span>, namely <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>; then the multitude of <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BG</span> is equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">EH</span> are also equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">GC</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span> are also equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as many numbers as there are in <span class="ital">BC</span> equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, so many are there also in <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever multiple <span class="ital">BC</span> is of <span class="ital">A</span>, the same multiple also is the sum of <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> of the sum of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever part <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">BC</span>, the same part also is the sum of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> of the sum of <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
