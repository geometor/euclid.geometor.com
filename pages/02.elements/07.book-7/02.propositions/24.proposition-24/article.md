       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers be prime to any number, their product also will be prime to the same.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers be prime to any number, their product also will be prime to the same.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be prime to any number <span class="ital">C</span>, and let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">E</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> are prime to one another, and a certain number <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.7.23">VII. 23</a>] </p>

<p>As many times, then, as <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> also measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has also made <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But, if the product of the extremes be equal to that of the means, the four numbers are proportional; [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are prime to one another, numbers which are prime to one another are also the least of those which have the same ratio, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them measure those which have the same ratio the same <pb n="326"/>number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.7.def.12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
