<h1>PROPOSITION 9.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number be a part of a number, and another be the same part of another, alternately also, whatever part or parts the first is of the third, the same part, or the same parts, will the second also be of the fourth.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> be a part of the number <span class="ital">BC</span>, and another, <span class="ital">D</span>, the same part of another, <span class="ital">EF</span>, that <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">BC</span>; I say that, alternately also, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">D</span>, the same part or parts is <span class="ital">BC</span> of <span class="ital">EF</span> also. 
      </p>

<p>For since, whatever part <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">BC</span>, the same part also is <span class="ital">D</span> of <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore, as many numbers as there are in <span class="ital">BC</span> equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, so many also are there in <span class="ital">EF</span> equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">BC</span> be divded into the numbers equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, namely <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span>, and <span class="ital">EF</span> into those equal to <span class="ital">D</span>, namely <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>; thus the multitude of <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since the numbers <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span> are equal to one another, and the numbers <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span> are also equal to one another, while the multitude of <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span> is equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>, therefore, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">BG</span> is of <span class="ital">EH</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">GC</span> of <span class="ital">HF</span> also; so that, in addition, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">BG</span> is of <span class="ital">EH</span>, the same part also, or the same parts, is the sum <span class="ital">BC</span> of the sum <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.5 elem.7.6">VII. 5, 6</a>] <pb n="310"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BG</span> is equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">D</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">BC</span> of <span class="ital">EF</span> also. Q. E. D.</p>
