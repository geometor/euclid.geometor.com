<h1>PROPOSITION 28.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, the sum will also be prime to each of them; and, if the sum of two numbers be prime to any one of them, the original numbers will also be prime to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let two numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> prime to one another be added; I say that the sum <span class="ital">AC</span> is also prime to each of the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">BA</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.7.def.12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are also prime to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CA</span> is prime to each of the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Again, let <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> be prime to one another; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also prime to one another. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. <pb n="330"/></p>

<p>Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">D</span> measures each of the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, it will also measure the whole <span class="ital">CA</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.7.def.12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
