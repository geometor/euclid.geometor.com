<h1>PROPOSITION 31.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Any composite number is measured by some prime number.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be a composite number; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is measured by some prime number. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is composite, <lb n="5"/>some number will measure it. </p>

<p>Let a number measure it, and let it be <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Now, if <span class="ital">B</span> is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>

<p>Let a number measure it, and let it be <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, and <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">A</span>. <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">C</span> is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>

<p>But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>

<p>Thus, if the investigation be continued in this way, some prime number will be found which will measure the number <lb n="20"/>before it, which will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>For, if it is not found, an infinite series of numbers will measure the number <span class="ital">A</span>, each of which is less than the other: which is impossible in numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore some prime number will be found which will <lb n="25"/>measure the one before it, which will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore any composite number is measured by some prime number.<pb n="333"/>
       <blockquote n="8. if B is prime, what was enjoined will have been done," class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">i.e. the implied <span class="ital">problem</span> of finding a prime number which measures <span class="ital">A</span>.</blockquote>
       <blockquote n="18. some prime number will be found which will measure." class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">In the Greek the sentence stops here, but it is necessary to add the words <quote>the number before it, which will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>,</quote>
 which are found a few lines further down. It is possible that the words may have fallen out of P here by a simple mistake due to <foreign lang="greek">ὁμοιοτέλευτον</foreign> (Heiberg).</blockquote></p>
