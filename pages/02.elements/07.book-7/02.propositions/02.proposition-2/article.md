<h1>PROPOSITION 2.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be the two given numbers not prime to one another. </p>

<p>Thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>If now <span class="ital">CD</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>—and it also measures itself—<span class="ital">CD</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for no greater number than <span class="ital">CD</span> will measure <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But, if <span class="ital">CD</span> does not measure <span class="ital">AB</span>, then, the less of the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> being continually subtracted from the greater, some number will be left which will measure the one before it. </p>

<p>For an unit will not be left; otherwise <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> will be prime to one another [<a href="/elem.7.1">VII. 1</a>], which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>

<p>Therefore some number will be left which will measure the one before it. </p>

<p>Now let <span class="ital">CD</span>, measuring <span class="ital">BE</span>, leave <span class="ital">EA</span> less than itself, let <span class="ital">EA</span>, measuring <span class="ital">DF</span>, leave <span class="ital">FC</span> less than itself, and let <span class="ital">CF</span> measure <span class="ital">AE</span>. </p>

<p>Since then, <span class="ital">CF</span> measures <span class="ital">AE</span>, and <span class="ital">AE</span> measures <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> will also measure <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures itself; therefore it will also measure the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CD</span> measures <span class="ital">BE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> also measures <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">EA</span>; therefore it will also measure the whole <span class="ital">BA</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. <pb n="299"/></p>

<p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">CF</span> is not the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, some number which is greater than <span class="ital">CF</span> will measure the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">CD</span>, while <span class="ital">CD</span> measures <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> also measures <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures the whole <span class="ital">BA</span>; therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">AE</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span> measures <span class="ital">DF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> will also measure <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>But it also measures the whole <span class="ital">DC</span>; therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">CF</span>, that is, the greater will measure the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no number which is greater than <span class="ital">CF</span> will measure the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; <span class="center">therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>.</span>

<p>From this it is manifest that, if a number measure two numbers, it will also measure their greatest common measure.</p>
