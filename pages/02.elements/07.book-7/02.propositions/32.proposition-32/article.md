<h1>PROPOSITION 32.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be a number; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> either is prime or is measured by some prime number. 
      </p>

<p>If now <span class="ital">A</span> is prime, that which was enjoined will have been done. </p>

<p>But if it is composite, some prime number will measure it. [<a href="/elem.7.31">VII. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number. Q. E. D.</p>
