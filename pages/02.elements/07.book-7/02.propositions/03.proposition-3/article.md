       <hi rend="ital">Given three numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Given three numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the three given numbers not prime to one another; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the greatest common measure, <span class="ital">D</span>, of the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.2">VII. 2</a>] then <span class="ital">D</span> either measures, or does not measure, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>First, let it measure it. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>I say that it is also the greatest. <pb n="301"/></p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">D</span> is not the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, some number which is greater than <span class="ital">D</span> will measure the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, it will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no number which is greater than <span class="ital">D</span> will measure the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; <span class="center">therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">D</span> not measure <span class="ital">C</span>; I say first that <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are not prime to one another. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. </p>

<p>Now that which measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will also measure <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, and will measure <span class="ital">D</span>, the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">C</span> also; therefore some number will measure the numbers <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are not prime to one another. </p>

<p>Let then their greatest common measure <span class="ital">E</span> be taken. [<a href="/elem.7.2">VII. 2</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> also measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">C</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">E</span> is not the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, some number which is greater than <span class="ital">E</span> will measure the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">F</span>. <pb n="302"/></p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, it also measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>And it measures <span class="ital">C</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no number which is greater than <span class="ital">E</span> will measure the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>.
