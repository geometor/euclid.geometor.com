<h1>PROPOSITION 20.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">EF</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">CD</span> is not parts of <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be so; therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is also the same parts of <span class="ital">B</span> that <span class="ital">CD</span> is of <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.13">VII. 13</a> and <a href="/elem.7.def.20">Def. 20</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Therefore, as many parts of <span class="ital">A</span> as there are in <span class="ital">CD</span>, so many parts of <span class="ital">B</span> are there also in <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">CD</span> be divded into the parts of <span class="ital">A</span>, namely <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span>, and <span class="ital">EF</span> into the parts of <span class="ital">B</span>, namely <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>; thus the multitude of <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>. <pb n="321"/></p>

<p>Now, since the numbers <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> are equal to one another, and the numbers <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span> are also equal to one another, while the multitude of <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> is equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">CG</span> is to <span class="ital">EH</span>, so is <span class="ital">GD</span> to <span class="ital">HF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents. [<a href="/elem.7.12">VII. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">CG</span> is to <span class="ital">EH</span>, so is <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">EH</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, being less than they: which is impossible, for by hypothesis <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is not parts of <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore it is a part of it. [<a href="/elem.7.4">VII. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EF</span> is the same part of <span class="ital">B</span> that <span class="ital">CD</span> is of <span class="ital">A</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.13">VII. 13</a> and <a href="/elem.7.def.20">Def. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">EF</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>.
