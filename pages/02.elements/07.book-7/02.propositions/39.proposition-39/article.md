===

<p>
       <span class="ital">To find the number which is the least that will have given parts.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the given parts; thus it is required to find the number which is the least that will have the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> be numbers called by the same name as the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, and let <span class="ital">G</span>, the least number measured by <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, be taken. [<a href="/elem.7.36">VII. 36</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">G</span> has parts called by the same name as <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.37">VII. 37</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are parts called by the same name as <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> has the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the least number that has. <pb n="344"/></p>

<p>For, if not, there will be some number less than <span class="ital">G</span> which will have the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let it be <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">H</span> has the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">H</span> will be measured by numbers called by the same name as the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.38">VII. 38</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are numbers called by the same name as the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">H</span> is measured by <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>And it is less than <span class="ital">G</span> : which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore there will be no number less than <span class="ital">G</span> that will have the parts <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
