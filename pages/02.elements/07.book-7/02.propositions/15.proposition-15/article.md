<p>
       <span class="ital">If an unit measure any number, and another number measure any other number the same number of times, alternately also, the unit will measure the third number the same number of times that the second measures the fourth.</span>
       <pb n="315"/>
      </p>

<p>For let the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measure any number <span class="ital">BC</span>, and let another number <span class="ital">D</span> measure any other number <span class="ital">EF</span> the same number of times; I say that, alternately also, the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measures the number <span class="ital">D</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">BC</span> measures <span class="ital">EF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measures the number <span class="ital">BC</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore, as many units as there are in <span class="ital">BC</span>, so many numbers equal to <span class="ital">D</span> are there in <span class="ital">EF</span> also. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">BC</span> be divded into the units in it, <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HC</span>, and <span class="ital">EF</span> into the numbers <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LF</span> equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Thus the multitude of <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HC</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the units <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HC</span> are equal to one another, and the numbers <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LF</span> are also equal to one another, while the multitude of the units <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HC</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LF</span>, therefore, as the unit <span class="ital">BG</span> is to the number <span class="ital">EK</span>, so will the unit <span class="ital">GH</span> be to the number <span class="ital">KL</span>, and the unit <span class="ital">HC</span> to the number <span class="ital">LF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents; [<a href="/elem.7.12">VII. 12</a>] therefore, as the unit <span class="ital">BG</span> is to the number <span class="ital">EK</span>, so is <span class="ital">BC</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>But the unit <span class="ital">BG</span> is equal to the unit <span class="ital">A</span>, and the number <span class="ital">EK</span> to the number <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the unit <span class="ital">A</span> is to the number <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">BC</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the unit <span class="ital">A</span> measures the number <span class="ital">D</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">BC</span> measures <span class="ital">EF</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
