       <hi rend="ital">Any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be a prime number, and let it not measure <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">C</span> measure them. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, and <span class="ital">A</span> does not measure <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">A</span>, therefore it also measures <span class="ital">A</span> which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible. <pb n="331"/></p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
