<h1>PROPOSITION 4.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Any number is either a part or parts of any number, the less of the greater.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be two numbers, and let <span class="ital">BC</span> be the less; I say that <span class="ital">BC</span> is either a part, or parts, of <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>For <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are either prime to one another or not. </p>

<p>First, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be prime to one another. </p>

<p>Then, if <span class="ital">BC</span> be divded into the units in it, each unit of those in <span class="ital">BC</span> will be some part of <span class="ital">A</span>; so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is parts of <span class="ital">A</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Next let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> not be prime to one another; then <span class="ital">BC</span> either measures, or does not measure, <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>If now <span class="ital">BC</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is a part of <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But, if not, let the greatest common measure <span class="ital">D</span> of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.2">VII. 2</a>] and let <span class="ital">BC</span> be divded into the numbers equal to <span class="ital">D</span>, namely <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FC</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is a part of <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to each of the numbers <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FC</span>; therefore each of the numbers <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FC</span> is also a part of <span class="ital">A</span>; so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is parts of <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
