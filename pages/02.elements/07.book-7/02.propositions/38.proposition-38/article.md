       <hi rend="ital">If a number have any part whatever, it will be measured by a number called by the same name as the part.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number have any part whatever, it will be measured by a number called by the same name as the part.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> have any part whatever, <span class="ital">B</span>, and let <span class="ital">C</span> be a number called by the same name as the part <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">B</span> is a part of <span class="ital">A</span> called by the same name as <span class="ital">C</span>, and the unit <span class="ital">D</span> is also a part of <span class="ital">C</span> called by the same name as it, therefore, whatever part the unit <span class="ital">D</span> is of the number <span class="ital">C</span>, the same part is <span class="ital">B</span> of <span class="ital">A</span> also; therefore the unit <span class="ital">D</span> measures the number <span class="ital">C</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>. <pb n="343"/></p>

<p>Therefore, alternately, the unit <span class="ital">D</span> measures the number <span class="ital">B</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.15">VII. 15</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
