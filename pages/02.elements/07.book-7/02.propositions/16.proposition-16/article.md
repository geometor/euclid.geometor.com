       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers by multiplying one another make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will be equal to one another.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers by multiplying one another make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will be equal to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two numbers, and let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>, and <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">A</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But the unit <span class="ital">E</span> also measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it; <span class="center">therefore the unit <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore, alternately, the unit <span class="ital">E</span> measures the number <span class="ital">B</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.15">VII. 15</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">A</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But the unit <span class="ital">E</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in it; <span class="center">therefore the unit <span class="ital">E</span> measures the number <span class="ital">B</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the unit <span class="ital">E</span> measured the number <span class="ital">B</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>; <span class="center">therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures each of the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> the same number of times.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="2. The numbers so produced." class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The Greek has <foreign lang="greek">οἰ γενόμενοι ἐξ αὐτῶν</foreign>, <quote>the (numbers) produced <span class="ital">from them</span>.</quote>
 By <quote>from them</quote>
 Euclid means <quote>from the original numbers,</quote>
 though this is not very clear even in the Greek. I think ambiguity is best avoided by leaving out the words.</blockquote></p>
