       <hi rend="ital">The square on a minor straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a fourth apotome.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">The square on a minor straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a fourth apotome.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a minor and <span class="ital">CD</span> a rational straight line, and to the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span> let <span class="ital">CE</span> be applied equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="ital">CF</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="ital">CF</span> is a fourth apotome. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BG</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> rational, but twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> medial. [<a href="/elem.10.76">X. 76</a>] </p>

<p>To <span class="ital">CD</span> let there be applied <span class="ital">CH</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> and producing <span class="ital">CK</span> as breadth, and <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">BG</span>, producing <span class="ital">KM</span> as breadth; therefore the whole <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>And the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">CL</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span>, producing <span class="ital">CM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] <pb n="222"/></p>

<p>And, since the whole <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and, in these, <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">FL</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">FM</span> be bisected at the point <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">NO</span> be drawn through <span class="ital">N</span> parallel to either of the straight lines <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">ML</span>; therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">FO</span>, <span class="ital">NL</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>And, since twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="ital">FL</span>, therefore <span class="ital">FL</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">FE</span>, producing <span class="ital">FM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">FM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is rational, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is medial, the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">FL</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CL</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">FL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CL</span> is to <span class="ital">FL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CM</span> to <span class="ital">MF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>I say that it is also a fourth apotome. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are incommensurable in square, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span>, and <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CH</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>. <pb n="223"/></p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CK</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is a mean proportional between the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CH</span>, the square on <span class="ital">GB</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> to <span class="ital">NL</span>, therefore <span class="ital">NL</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="ital">CH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">NL</span>, so is <span class="ital">NL</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">NL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CK</span> to <span class="ital">NM</span>, and, as <span class="ital">NL</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is <span class="ital">NM</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">CK</span> is to <span class="ital">MN</span>, so is <span class="ital">MN</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span> [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>], that is, to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">FM</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span> are two unequal straight lines, and the rectangle <span class="ital">CK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">MF</span> and deficient by a square figure has been applied to <span class="ital">CM</span> and divdes it into incommensurable parts, therefore the square on <span class="ital">CM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MF</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">CM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] </p>

<p>And the whole <span class="ital">CM</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is a fourth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.4">X. Deff. III. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
