<p><hi rend="ital">If an area be contained by an apotome and the binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the apotome and in the same ratio, the <quote>side</quote>

<p><span class="ital">If an area be contained by an apotome and the binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the apotome and in the same ratio, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is rational</span>. </p>

<p>For let an area, the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, be contained by the apotome <span class="ital">AB</span> and the binomial straight line <span class="ital">CD</span>, and let <span class="ital">CE</span> be the greater term of the latter; let the terms <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> of the binomial straight line be commensurable with the terms <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span> of the apotome and in the same ratio; and let the <quote>side</quote>
 of the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be <span class="ital">G</span>; I say that <span class="ital">G</span> is rational. 
      </p>

<p>For let a rational straight line <span class="ital">H</span> be set out, and to <span class="ital">CD</span> let there be applied a rectangle equal to the square on <span class="ital">H</span> and producing <span class="ital">KL</span> as breadth. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">KL</span> is an apotome. </p>

<p>Let its terms be <span class="ital">KM</span>, <span class="ital">ML</span> commensurable with the terms <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> of the binomial straight line and in the same ratio. [<a href="/elem.10.112">X. 112</a>] <pb n="253"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> are also commensurable with <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span> and in the same ratio; therefore, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">FB</span>, so is <span class="ital">KM</span> to <span class="ital">ML</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, alternately, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">KM</span>, so is <span class="ital">BF</span> to <span class="ital">LM</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the remainder <span class="ital">KL</span> as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19">V. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AF</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> is also commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">G</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">G</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">H</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">G</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> is rational. </p>

<p>And it is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. </p>

<p>And it is made manifest to us by this also that it is possible for a rational area to be contained by irrational straight lines. Q. E. D.</p>
