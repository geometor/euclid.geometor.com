<h1>PROPOSITION 89.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To find the fifth apotome</span>. </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> be set out, and let <span class="ital">CG</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CG</span> is rational. </p>

<p>Let two numbers <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span> be set out such that <span class="ital">DE</span> again has not to either of the numbers <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">FE</span> is to <span class="ital">ED</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">GB</span> is also rational; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore <span class="ital">BG</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">DE</span> is to <span class="ital">EF</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GC</span>, while <span class="ital">DE</span> has not to <span class="ital">EF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">BG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GC</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] <pb n="187"/></p>

<p>I say next that it is also a fifth apotome. </p>

<p>For let the square on <span class="ital">H</span> be that by which the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GC</span>. </p>

<p>Since then, as the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">GC</span>, so is <span class="ital">DE</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as <span class="ital">ED</span> is to <span class="ital">DF</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">ED</span> has not to <span class="ital">DF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">BG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GC</span> by the square on <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">GB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GC</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>And the annex <span class="ital">CG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is a fifth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.5">X. Deff. III. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the fifth apotome <span class="ital">BC</span> has been found. Q. E. D.</p>
