<h1>PROPOSITION 102.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">The square on the straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a sixth apotome.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole, and <span class="ital">CD</span> a rational straight line, and to <span class="ital">CD</span> let <span class="ital">CE</span> be applied equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="ital">CF</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="ital">CF</span> is a sixth apotome. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BG</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> medial, and the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.78">X. 78</a>] </p>

<p>Now to <span class="ital">CD</span> let there be applied <span class="ital">CH</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> and producing <span class="ital">CK</span> as breadth, and <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">BG</span>; therefore the whole <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CL</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span>, producing <span class="ital">CM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Since now <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and, in these, <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">FL</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] </p>

<p>And twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">FL</span> is also medial. <pb n="228"/></p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">FE</span>, producing <span class="ital">FM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">FM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">FL</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">CL</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">FL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CL</span> is to <span class="ital">FL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CM</span> to <span class="ital">MF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a sixth apotome. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">FL</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, let <span class="ital">FM</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">NO</span> be drawn through <span class="ital">N</span> parallel to <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">FO</span>, <span class="ital">NL</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are incommensurable in square, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span>, and <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CH</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CK</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CK</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is a mean proportional between the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">CH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">NL</span> equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">NL</span> is also a mean proportional between <span class="ital">CH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">NL</span>, so is <span class="ital">NL</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>. <pb n="229"/></p>

<p>And for the same reason as before the square on <span class="ital">CM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MF</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">CM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] </p>

<p>And neither of them is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is a sixth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.6">X. Deff. III. 6</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
