<p><span class="ital">The square on a rational straight line, if applied to an apotome, produces as, breadth the binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the apotome and in the same ratio; and further the binomial so arising has the same order as the apotome</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be a rational straight line and <span class="ital">BD</span> an apotome, and let the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>, so that the square on the rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> when applied to the apotome <span class="ital">BD</span> produces <span class="ital">KH</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="ital">KH</span> is a binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of <span class="ital">BD</span> and in the same ratio; and further <span class="ital">KH</span> has the same order as <span class="ital">BD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">DC</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Let the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> be also equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is rational; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And it has been applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] <pb n="249"/></p>

<p>Since now the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span>, therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">CB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is <span class="ital">KH</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.16">VI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>, <a href="/elem.5.14">V. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">KE</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">G</span>; therefore <span class="ital">KE</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">CB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is <span class="ital">HK</span> to <span class="ital">KE</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">KH</span> to <span class="ital">HE</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">KH</span> is to <span class="ital">HE</span>, so is <span class="ital">HF</span> to <span class="ital">FE</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">KF</span> is to <span class="ital">FH</span> as <span class="ital">KH</span> is to <span class="ital">HE</span>, that is, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19">V. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">KH</span> is to <span class="ital">HE</span>, so is <span class="ital">KF</span> to <span class="ital">FH</span>, while, as <span class="ital">KH</span> is to <span class="ital">HE</span>, so is <span class="ital">HF</span> to <span class="ital">FE</span>, therefore also, as <span class="ital">KF</span> is to <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is <span class="ital">HF</span> to <span class="ital">FE</span>, [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] so that also, as the first is to the third, so is the square on the first to the square on the second; [<a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] therefore also, as <span class="ital">KF</span> is to <span class="ital">FE</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">KF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">KF</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">FH</span>, for <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> are commensurable in square; therefore <span class="ital">KF</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FE</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] so that <span class="ital">KF</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">KE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KE</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">KF</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] </p>

<p>And, since, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">KF</span> to <span class="ital">FH</span>, alternately, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">KF</span>, so is <span class="ital">DC</span> to <span class="ital">FH</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">KF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] <pb n="250"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> are also rational straight lines [<a href="/elem.10.def.3">X. Def. 3</a>] commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>If now the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>, the square on <span class="ital">KF</span> will also be greater than the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">KF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is <span class="ital">KF</span>; if <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is <span class="ital">FH</span>, but, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, then neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span>. </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>, the square on <span class="ital">KF</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">KF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, so also is <span class="ital">KF</span>; if <span class="ital">CD</span> is so commensurable, in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is <span class="ital">FH</span>; but, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, then neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is a binomial straight line, the terms of which <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span> are commensurable with the terms <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> of the apotome and in the same ratio, and further <span class="ital">KH</span> has the same order as <span class="ital">BD</span>.
