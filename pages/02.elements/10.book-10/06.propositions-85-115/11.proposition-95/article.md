<p>
       <span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a fifth apotome, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">AB</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> and the fifth apotome <span class="ital">AD</span>; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">DG</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only,  the annex <span class="ital">GD</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> set out, and the square on the whole <span class="ital">AG</span> is greater than the square <pb n="207"/>on the annex <span class="ital">DG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">AG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.5">X. Deff. III. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, if there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">DG</span> and deficient by a square figure, it will divde it into incommensurable parts. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">DG</span> be bisected at the point <span class="ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on <span class="ital">EG</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CA</span>, and both are rational, therefore <span class="ital">AK</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">DG</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DK</span> is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Now let the square <span class="ital">LM</span> be constructed equal to <span class="ital">AI</span>, and let the square <span class="ital">NO</span> equal to <span class="ital">FK</span> and about the same angle, the angle <span class="ital">LPM</span>, be subtracted; therefore the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are about the same diameter. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">PR</span> be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn. </p>

<p>Similarly then we can prove that <span class="ital">LN</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">LN</span> is the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AK</span> was proved medial and is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> is medial. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">DK</span> is rational and is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>, the latter is itself also rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AI</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">LP</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">PN</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> are straight lines incommensurable in <pb n="208"/>square which make the sum of the squares on them medial but twice the rectangle contained by them rational. </p>

<p>Therefore the remainder <span class="ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called that which produces with a rational area a medial whole; [<a href="/elem.10.77">X. 77</a>] and it is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. Q. E. D.</p>
