<p><span class="ital">To find the sixth apotome</span>. </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> be set out, and three numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> not having to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and further let <span class="ital">CB</span> also not have to <span class="ital">BD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, and, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">E</span> has not to <span class="ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BC</span> has not to <span class="ital">CD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, <pb n="189"/>therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a sixth apotome. </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, and, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">v. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span> has not to <span class="ital">CD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GH</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Now let the square on <span class="ital">K</span> be that by which the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>Since then, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as <span class="ital">CB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">v. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CB</span> has not to <span class="ital">BD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">K</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> by the square on <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. <pb n="190"/></p>

<p>And neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> set out. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is a sixth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.6">X. Deff. III. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the sixth apotome <span class="ital">FH</span> has been found. Q. E. D.</p>
