<p><span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a sixth apotome, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole</span>. </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">AB</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> and the sixth apotome <span class="ital">AD</span>; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">DG</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, neither of them is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> set out, and the square on the whole <span class="ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on the annex <span class="ital">DG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.6">X. Deff. III. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Since then the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AG</span>, therefore, if there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">DG</span> and deficient by a square figure, it will divde it into incommensurable parts. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">DG</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the square <pb n="210"/>on <span class="ital">EG</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">FG</span>, so is <span class="ital">AI</span> to <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AI</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, <span class="ital">AK</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DG</span> are rational straight lines and incommensurable in length, <span class="ital">DK</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> are commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="ital">AG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GD</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AG</span> is to <span class="ital">GD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AK</span> to <span class="ital">KD</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AK</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">KD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Now let the square <span class="ital">LM</span> be constructed equal to <span class="ital">AI</span>, and let <span class="ital">NO</span> equal to <span class="ital">FK</span>, and about the same angle, be subtracted; therefore the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are about the same diameter. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">PR</span> be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn. </p>

<p>Then in manner similar to the above we can prove that <span class="ital">LN</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">LN</span> is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AK</span> was proved medial and is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> is medial. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">DK</span> was proved medial and is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AK</span> was proved incommensurable with <span class="ital">DK</span>, the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> are also incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AI</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">LP</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">PN</span>; <pb n="211"/>therefore <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, twice the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the squares on them incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by them. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called that which produces with a medial area a medial whole; [<a href="/elem.10.78">X. 78</a>] and it is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. Q. E. D.</p>
