<h1>PROPOSITION 94.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a fourth apotome, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is minor</span>. </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">AB</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> and the fourth apotome <span class="ital">AD</span>; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is minor. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">DG</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">AC</span> set out, and the square on the whole <span class="ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on the annex <span class="ital">DG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AG</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.4">X. Deff. III. 4</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Since then the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AG</span>, therefore, if there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">DG</span> and deficient by a square figure, it will divde it into incommensurable parts. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">DG</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on <span class="ital">EG</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. <pb n="204"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">FI</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> be drawn through <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> parallel to <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">AG</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AC</span>, therefore the whole <span class="ital">AK</span> is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">DG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AC</span>, and both are rational, therefore <span class="ital">DK</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AI</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Now let the square <span class="ital">LM</span> be constructed equal to <span class="ital">AI</span>, and let there be subtracted <span class="ital">NO</span> equal to <span class="ital">FK</span> and about the same angle, the angle <span class="ital">LPM</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are about the same diameter. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">PR</span> be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn. </p>

<p>Since then the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="ital">EG</span> to <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AF</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="ital">AI</span> to <span class="ital">EK</span>, and, as <span class="ital">EG</span> is to <span class="ital">FG</span>, so is <span class="ital">EK</span> to <span class="ital">FK</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="ital">AI</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">MN</span> is also a mean proportional between the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, and <span class="ital">AI</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LM</span>, and <span class="ital">FK</span> to <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">MN</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EK</span>, and <span class="ital">LO</span> is equal to <span class="ital">MN</span>; therefore the whole <span class="ital">DK</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="ital">UVW</span> and <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>Since, then, the whole <span class="ital">AK</span> is equal to the squares <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, and, in these, <span class="ital">DK</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="ital">UVW</span> and the square <span class="ital">NO</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">ST</span>, that is, to the square on <span class="ital">LN</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LN</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span>. <pb n="205"/></p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AK</span> is rational and is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> is rational. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">DK</span> is medial, and <span class="ital">DK</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span>, therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> is medial. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AI</span> was proved incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">LP</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">PN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">PN</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but twice the rectangle contained by them medial. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called minor; [<a href="/elem.10.76">X. 76</a>] and it is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AB</span> is minor. Q. E. D.</p>
