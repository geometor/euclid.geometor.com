<p><hi rend="ital">To a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole only one straight line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole straight line and which with the whole straight line makes the sum of the squares <pb n="175"/>on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them both medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them</hi>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">To a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole only one straight line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole straight line and which with the whole straight line makes the sum of the squares <pb n="175"/>on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them both medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole, and <span class="ital">BC</span> an annex to it; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which fulfil the aforesaid conditions. [<a href="/elem.10.78">X. 78</a>] 
      </p>

<p>I say that no other straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which fulfils the aforesaid conditions. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">BD</span> be so annexed, so that <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> added together medial, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> medial, and also the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.78">X. 78</a>] </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out, let <span class="ital">EG</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EM</span> as breadth, and let <span class="ital">HG</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">HM</span> as breadth; therefore the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>], is equal to <span class="ital">EL</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">EL</span>. </p>

<p>Again, let <span class="ital">EI</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EN</span> as breadth. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">EL</span>; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>], is equal to <span class="ital">HI</span>. <pb n="176"/></p>

<p>Now, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">EM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="ital">HG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">HG</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">HM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">HM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">HG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EM</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MH</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">EM</span>, <span class="ital">MH</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is an apotome, and <span class="ital">HM</span> an annex to it. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">EH</span> is again an apotome and <span class="ital">HN</span> an annex to it. </p>

<p>Therefore to an apotome different rational straight lines are annexed which are commensurable with the wholes in square only: which was proved impossible. [<a href="/elem.10.79">X. 79</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no other straight line can be so annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore to <span class="ital">AB</span> only one straight line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which with the whole makes the squares on them added together medial, twice the rectangle contained by them medial, and also the squares on them incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by them.
