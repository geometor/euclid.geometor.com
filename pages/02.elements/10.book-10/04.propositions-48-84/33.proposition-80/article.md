<p><span class="ital">To a first apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle</span>. <pb n="169"/></p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a first apotome of a medial straight line, and let <span class="ital">BC</span> be an annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> which they contain is rational; [<a href="/elem.10.74">X. 74</a>] I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational area. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">DB</span> also be so annexed; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> which they contain is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.74">X. 74</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Now, since the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, for they exceed by the same, the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is also the excess of twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>But twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area, for both are rational. </p>

<p>Therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> also exceed the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area. which is impossible, for both are medial [<a href="/elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 15 and 23, Por.</a>], and a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [<a href="/elem.10.26">X. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
