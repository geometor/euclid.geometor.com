<p><span class="ital">To find the first binomial straight line</span>. </p>

<p>Let two numbers <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be set out such that the sum of them <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to <span class="ital">CA</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; [<a href="/elem.10.28.l.1">Lemma I after X. 28</a>]  let any rational straight line <span class="ital">D</span> be set out, and let <span class="ital">EF</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as the number <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> also has to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> the ratio which a number has to a number, so that the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EF</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BA</span> has not to <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. <pb n="103"/>neither, therefore, has the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>I say that it is also a first binomial straight line. </p>

<p>For since, as the number <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, while <span class="ital">BA</span> is greater than <span class="ital">AC</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>Let then the squares on <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, therefore, <span class="ital">convertendo</span>, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> also has to the square on <span class="ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">H</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> are rational, and <span class="ital">EF</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is a first binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
