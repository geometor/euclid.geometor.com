<p><hi rend="ital">The square on the side of a rational plus a medial area applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fifth binomial</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The square on the side of a rational plus a medial area applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fifth binomial</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the side of a rational plus a medial area, divded into its straight lines at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is the greater; let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span> the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="ital">DG</span> is a fifth binomial straight line. 
      </p>

<p>Let the same construction as before be made. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">AB</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area, divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [<a href="/elem.10.40">X. 40</a>] </p>

<p>Since then the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is medial, therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is medial, so that <span class="ital">DM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, that is <span class="ital">MF</span>, is rational, therefore <span class="ital">MG</span> is rational and commensurable with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">MG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line. </p>

<p>For it can be proved similarly that the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>, and that <span class="ital">DK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">KM</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">DM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] <pb n="143"/></p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are commensurable in square only, and the less, <span class="ital">MG</span>, is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is a fifth binomial. Q. E. D.</p>
