<h1>PROPOSITION 71.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If a rational and a medial area be added together, four irrational straight lines arise, namely a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area</span>. </p>

<p>Let. <span class="ital">AB</span> be rational, and <span class="ital">CD</span> medial; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AD</span> is a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area. <pb n="152"/></p>

<p>For <span class="ital">AB</span> is either greater or less than <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>First, let it be greater; let a rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out, let there be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span> the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span> equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="ital">EH</span> as breadth, and let <span class="ital">HI</span>, equal to <span class="ital">DC</span>, be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">HK</span> as breadth. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is rational and is equal to <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And it has been applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EH</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">CD</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="ital">HI</span>, therefore <span class="ital">HI</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">HK</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span> [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">CD</span> is medial, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is rational, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">CD</span>, so that <span class="ital">EG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">HI</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">EG</span> is to <span class="ital">HI</span>, so is <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">HK</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">HK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a binomial straight line, divded at <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] <pb n="153"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CD</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EG</span> and <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">HI</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">HI</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">HK</span>. </p>

<p>The square, then, on <span class="ital">EH</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <span class="ital">EH</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>

<p>First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with itself. </p>

<p>Now the greater straight line <span class="ital">HE</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a first binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EF</span> is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, the side of the square equal to the area is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.54">X. 54</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">EI</span> is binomial; so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AD</span> is also binomial. </p>

<p>Next, let the square on <span class="ital">EH</span> be greater than the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">EH</span>. </p>

<p>Now the greater straight line <span class="ital">EH</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a fourth binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.4">X. Deff. II. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EF</span> is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fourth binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line called major. [<a href="/elem.10.57">X. 57</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">EI</span> is major; so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AD</span> is also major. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">AB</span> be less than <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also less than <span class="ital">HI</span>, so that <span class="ital">EH</span> is also less than <span class="ital">HK</span>. </p>

<p>Now the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EH</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">HK</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. <pb n="154"/></p>

<p>First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with itself. </p>

<p>Now the lesser straight line <span class="ital">EH</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a second binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.2">X. Deff. II. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EF</span> is rational, and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, the side of the square equal to it is a first bimedial; [<a href="/elem.10.55">X. 55</a>] therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">EI</span> is a first bimedial, so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AD</span> is also a first bimedial. </p>

<p>Next, let the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> be greater than the square on <span class="ital">HE</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">HK</span>. </p>

<p>Now the lesser straight line <span class="ital">EH</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">EK</span> is a fifth binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.5">X. Deff. II. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EF</span> is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the side of the square equal to the area is a side of a rational plus a medial area. [<a href="/elem.10.58">X. 58</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">EI</span> is a side of a rational plus a medial area, so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AD</span> is also a side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
