<h1>PROPOSITION 51.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To find the fourth binomial straight line</span>. </p>

<p>Let two numbers <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be set out such that <span class="ital">AB</span> neither has to <span class="ital">BC</span>, nor yet to <span class="ital">AC</span>, the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">D</span> be set out, and let <span class="ital">EF</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as the number <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is also rational. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">BA</span> has not to <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that <span class="ital">EG</span> is binomial. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a fourth binomial straight line. </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>Let then the squares on <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>; <pb n="110"/>therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as the number <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> has not to <span class="ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">H</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GF</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and <span class="ital">EF</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is a fourth binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
