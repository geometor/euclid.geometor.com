<h1>PROPOSITION 83.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole only one straight line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole straight line and which with the whole straight line makes the sum of the squares on them medial, but twice the rectangle contained by them rational</span>. <pb n="174"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and let <span class="ital">BC</span> be an annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which fulfil the given conditions. [<a href="/elem.10.77">X. 77</a>] 
      </p>

<p>I say that no other straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which fulfils the same conditions. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">BD</span> be so annexed; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which fulfil the given conditions. [<a href="/elem.10.77">X. 77</a>] </p>

<p>Since then, as in the preceding cases, the excess of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is also the excess of twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area, for both are rational, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> also exceed the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area: which is impossible, for both are medial. [<a href="/elem.10.26">X. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no other straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which with the whole fulfils the aforesaid conditions; therefore only one straight line can be so annexed. Q. E. D.</p>
