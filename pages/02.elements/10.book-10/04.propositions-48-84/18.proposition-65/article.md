<h1>PROPOSITION 65.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">The square on the side of the sum of two medial areas applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the sixth binomial</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the side of the sum of two medial areas, divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, let <span class="ital">DE</span> be a rational straight line, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span> the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as its breadth; <pb n="144"/>I say that <span class="ital">DG</span> is a sixth binomial straight line. </p>

<p>For let the same construction be made as before. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas, divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and moreover the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle contained by them, [<a href="/elem.10.41">X. 41</a>]  so that, in accordance with what was before proved, each of the rectangles <span class="ital">DL</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span> is medial. </p>

<p>And they are applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">MF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">MG</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a sixth binomial straight line. </p>

<p>Similarly again we can prove that the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>, and that <span class="ital">DK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">KM</span>; and, for the same reason, the square on <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DM</span>. </p>

<p>And neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> set out. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is a sixth binomial straight line. Q. E. D.<pb n="145"/></p>
