<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be major, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is major. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be divded at <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [<a href="/elem.10.39">X. 39</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before. </p>

<p>Then since, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>, and <span class="ital">EB</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>, therefore also, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">EB</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are also commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> respectively. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">EB</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>, alternately also, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] therefore also, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BE</span>, so is <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">DF</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.20">VI. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that, as the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">AE</span>, so also is the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> to the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>; therefore also, alternately, as the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>, so are the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> to the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are also commensurable with the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. <pb n="150"/></p>

<p>And the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> together are rational; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> together are rational. </p>

<p>Similarly also twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is commensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>And twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is medial; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial; therefore the whole <span class="ital">CD</span> is the irrational straight line called major. [<a href="/elem.10.39">X. 39</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major straight line is major. Q. E. D.</p>
