===

<p><span class="ital">To find the third binomial straight line</span>. </p>

<p>Let two numbers <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be set out such that the sum of them <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>

<p>Let any other number <span class="ital">D</span>, not square, be set out also, and let it not have to either of the numbers <span class="ital">BA</span>. <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>

<p>Let any rational straight line <span class="ital">E</span> be set out, and let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">AB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">E</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">E</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is also rational. <pb n="107"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">D</span> has not to <span class="ital">AB</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on <span class="ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Next let it be contrived that, as the number <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">FG</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BA</span> has not to <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">HG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a third binomial straight line. </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">AB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>, and, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> has not to <span class="ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>Let then the squares on <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">FG</span>; <pb n="108"/>therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> also has to the square on <span class="ital">K</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GH</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is a third binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
