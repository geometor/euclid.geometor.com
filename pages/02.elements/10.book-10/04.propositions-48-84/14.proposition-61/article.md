<h1>PROPOSITION 61.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">The square on the first bimedial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the second binomial</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a first bimedial straight line divded into its medials at <span class="ital">C</span>, of which medials <span class="ital">AC</span> is the greater; let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span> the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="ital">DG</span> is a second binominal straight line. 
      </p>

<p>For let the same construction as before be made. <pb n="136"/></p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is a first bimedial divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only, and containing a rational rectangle, [<a href="/elem.10.37">X. 37</a>] so that the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 15 and 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And it has been applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MD</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is rational, <span class="ital">MF</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">ML</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MG</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">ML</span>, that is, <span class="ital">DE</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And they are rational; therefore <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>It is next to be proved that it is also a second binomial straight line. </p>

<p>For, since the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">MF</span>, so that <span class="ital">DM</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">MG</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">DH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>, so that <span class="ital">DK</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">DM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.17">X. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">MG</span> is commensurable is length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is a second binomial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.2">X. Deff. II. 2</a>]</p>
