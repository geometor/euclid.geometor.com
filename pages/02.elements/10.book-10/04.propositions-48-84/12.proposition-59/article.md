<p>
       <span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the sixth binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of the sum of two medial areas.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">ABCD</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and the sixth binomial <span class="ital">AD</span>, divded into its terms at <span class="ital">E</span>, so that <span class="ital">AE</span> is the greater term; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AC</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before shown. 
      </p>

<p>It is then manifest that <span class="ital">MO</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AC</span>, and that <span class="ital">MN</span> is incommensurable in square with <span class="ital">NO.</span>
      </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">EA</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">AK</span>, that is, the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">ED</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">FE</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">EK</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MR</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">AK</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">EL.</span> [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AK</span> is the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, and <span class="ital">EL</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO.</span>
      </p>

<p>And each of them is medial, and <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are incommensurable in square. <pb n="131"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas [<a href="/elem.10.41">X. 41</a>], and is the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AC</span>. Q. E. D.

<div id="elem.10.59.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>[LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>If a straight line be cut into unequal parts, the squares on the unequal parts are greater than twice the rectangle contained by the unequal parts. 
       </p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a straight line, and let it be cut into unequal parts at <span class="ital">C</span>, and let <span class="ital">AC</span> be the greater; I say that the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. <pb n="132"/></p>

       
<p>For let <span class="ital">AB</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

       
<p>Since then a straight line has been cut into equal parts at <span class="ital">D</span>, and into unequal parts at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.5">II. 5</a>] so that the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is less than double of the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>. </p>

       
<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are double of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>; [<a href="/elem.2.9">II. 9</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>.
