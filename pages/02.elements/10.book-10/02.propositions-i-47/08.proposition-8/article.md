<p><hi rend="ital">If two magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the magnitudes will be incommensurable</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</span>, <span class="ital">the magnitudes will be incommensurable</span>. </p>

<p>For let the two magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> not have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number; I say that the magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are incommensurable. 
      </p>

<p>For, if they are commensurable, <span class="ital">A</span> will have to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/elem.10.5">X. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But it has not; therefore the magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are incommensurable. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
