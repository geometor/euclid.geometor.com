<h1>PROPOSITION 2.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If, when the less of two unequal magnitudes is continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left never measures the one before it, the magnitudes will be incommensurable.</span>
      </p>

<p>For, there being two unequal magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, and <span class="ital">AB</span> being the less, when the less is continually subtracted in turn from the greater, let that which is left over never measure the one before it; I say that the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are incommensurable. 
      </p>

<p>For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>

<p>Let a magnitude measure them, if possible, and let it be <span class="ital">E</span>; let <span class="ital">AB</span>, measuring <span class="ital">FD</span>, leave <span class="ital">CF</span> less than itself, let <span class="ital">CF</span> measuring <span class="ital">BG</span>, leave <span class="ital">AG</span> less than itself, and let this process be repeated continually, until there is left some magnitude which is less than <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Suppose this done, and let there be left <span class="ital">AG</span> less than <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> measures <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> will also measure <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures the whole <span class="ital">CD</span> also; therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CF</span> measures <span class="ital">BG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> also measures <span class="ital">BG</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> also; therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">AG</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no magnitude will measure the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are incommensurable. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. [<a href="/elem.10.def.1">X. Def. 1</a>]<pb n="18"/></p>
