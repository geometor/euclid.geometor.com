<h1>PROPOSITION 46.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">The side of a rational plus a medial area is divded at one point only</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the side of a rational plus a medial area divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> medial, but twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> rational; [<a href="/elem.10.40">X. 40</a>
] I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not so divded at another point. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be divded at <span class="ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> medial, but twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> rational. </p>

<p>Since then that by which twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also that by which the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> by a rational area, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> also exceed the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area, though they are medial: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.10.26">X. 26</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore the side of a rational plus a medial area is not divded at different points; therefore it is divded at one point only. Q. E. D.</p>
