<h1>PROPOSITION 37.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called</span>
       <span class="bold">a first bimedial</span>
       <span class="ital">straight line</span>. </p>

<p>For let two medial straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together;  I say that the whole <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; [cf. <a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36, ll. 9-20</a>]<pb n="85"/>
and, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>], is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>
] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational, for, by hypothesis, <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are straight lines containing a rational rectangle; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>And let it be called a <span class="bold">first bimedial</span> straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
