<h1>PROPOSITION 6.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</span>, <span class="ital">the magnitudes will be commensurable</span>. </p>

<p>For let the two magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the number <span class="ital">D</span> has to the number <span class="ital">E</span>; <lb n="5"/>I say that the magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are commensurable. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span> be divded into as many equal parts as there are units in <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">C</span> be equal to one of them; and let <span class="ital">F</span> be made up of as many magnitudes equal to <span class="ital">C</span> as <lb n="10"/>there are units in <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Since then there are in <span class="ital">A</span> as many magnitudes equal to <span class="ital">C</span> as there are units in <span class="ital">D</span>, whatever part the unit is of <span class="ital">D</span>, the same part is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">A</span> also; therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is the unit to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>But the unit measures the number <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is the unit to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, inversely, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is the number <span class="ital">D</span> to the unit. [cf. <a href="/elem.5.7.p.1">V. 7, Por.</a>] <lb n="20"/></p>

<p>Again, since there are in <span class="ital">F</span> as many magnitudes equal to <span class="ital">C</span> as there are units in <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is the unit to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>But it was also proved that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to the unit;</span>
       <lb n="25"/>therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">v. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is it to <span class="ital">F</span> also. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>; <lb n="30"/>therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is equal to <span class="ital">F</span>. A[<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore it measures <span class="ital">B</span> also. </p>

<p>Further it measures <span class="ital">A</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. <pb n="27"/><lb n="35"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. </p>
<div id="elem.10.6.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
       
<p>From this it is manifest that, if there be two numbers, as <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, and a straight line, as <span class="ital">A</span>, it is possible to make a straight line [<span class="ital">F</span>] such that the given straight line is to <lb n="40"/>it as the number <span class="ital">D</span> is to the number <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

       
<p>And, if a mean proportional be also taken between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, as <span class="ital">B</span>, </p>

       
<p>as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so will the square on <span class="ital">A</span> be to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, that is, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first <lb n="45"/>to that which is similar and similarly described on the second. [<a href="/elem.6.19.p.1">VI. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

       
<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is the number <span class="ital">D</span> to the number <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore it has been contrived that, as the number <span class="ital">D</span> is to the number <span class="ital">E</span>, so also is the figure on the straight line <span class="ital">A</span> to the figure on the straight line <span class="ital">B</span>.
