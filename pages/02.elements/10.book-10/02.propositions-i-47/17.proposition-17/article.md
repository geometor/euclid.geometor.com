<h1>PROPOSITION 17.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divde it into parts which are commensurable in length, then <lb n="5"/>the square on the greater will be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater.</span>
      </p>

<p><span class="ital">And, if the square on the greater be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with</span>
       <pb n="42"/><lb n="10"/><span class="ital">the greater, and if there be applied to the greater a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, it will divde it into parts which are commensurable in length</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be two unequal straight lines, of which <span class="ital">BC</span> is <lb n="15"/>the greater, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">BC</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, <span class="ital">A</span>, that is, equal to the square on the half of <span class="ital">A</span>, and deficient <lb n="20"/>by a square figure. Let this be the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>, [cf. Lemma]  and let <span class="ital">BD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>; I say that the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>. <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BC</span> be bisected at the point <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">EF</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the remainder <span class="ital">DC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the straight line <span class="ital">BC</span> has been cut into equal parts at <span class="ital">E</span>, and into unequal parts at <span class="ital">D</span>, <lb n="30"/>therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>, together with the square on <span class="ital">ED</span>, is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EC</span>; [<a href="/elem.2.5">II. 5</a>] </p>

<p>And the same is true of their quadruples; therefore four times the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>, together with four times the square on <span class="ital">DE</span>, is equal to four times the square <lb n="35"/>on <span class="ital">EC</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is equal to four times the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>; and the square on <span class="ital">DF</span> is equal to four times the square on <span class="ital">DE</span>, for <span class="ital">DF</span> is double of <span class="ital">DE</span>. <lb n="40"/></p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to four times the square on <span class="ital">EC</span>, for again <span class="ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the squares on <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">BC</span>, so that the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by <lb n="45"/>the square on <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>It is to be proved that <span class="ital">BC</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">BD</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [X. 15] <pb n="43"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">BF</span>, for <lb n="50"/><span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] <lb n="55"/>therefore the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> be greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>, let a parallelogram be applied to <span class="ital">BC</span> equal to the fourth part <lb n="60"/>of the square on <span class="ital">A</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>It is to be proved that <span class="ital">BD</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>With the same construction, we can prove similarly that <lb n="65"/>the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FD</span>, <lb n="70"/>so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with the remainder, the sum of <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But the sum of <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">DC</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] and therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is commensurable in length <lb n="75"/>with <span class="ital">DC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.
