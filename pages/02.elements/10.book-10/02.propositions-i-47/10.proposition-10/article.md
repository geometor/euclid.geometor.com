<h1>PROPOSITION 10.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with an assigned straight line</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be the assigned straight line; thus it is required to find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Let two numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be set out which have not to one <pb n="32"/>another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers; and let it be contrived that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span></span>
        —for we have learnt how to do this— [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">B</span> has not to <span class="ital">C</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">E</span> be taken a mean proportional between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">E</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable in square with <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore two straight lines <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> have been found incommensurable, <span class="ital">D</span> in length only, and <span class="ital">E</span> in square and of course in length also, with the assigned straight line <span class="ital">A</span>.]</p>
