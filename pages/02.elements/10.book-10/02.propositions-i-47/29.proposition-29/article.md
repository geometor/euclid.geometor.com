<h1>PROPOSITION 29.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To find two rational straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with the greater</span>. </p>

<p>For let there be set out any rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span>, and two square numbers <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> such that their difference <span class="ital">CE</span> is not square; [<a href="/elem.10.28.l.1">Lemma 1</a>] let there be described on <span class="ital">AB</span> the semicircle <span class="ital">AFB</span>, <pb n="67"/>and let it be contrived that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">DC</span> is to <span class="ital">CE</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="ital">AF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">FB</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Since, as the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">AF</span>, so is <span class="ital">DC</span> to <span class="ital">CE</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">AF</span> the ratio which the number <span class="ital">DC</span> has to the number <span class="ital">CE</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">AF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] 
      </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is rational; [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">AF</span> is also rational; [<span class="ital">id.</span>] therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">DC</span> has not to <span class="ital">CE</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="ital">AF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">DC</span> is to <span class="ital">CE</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="ital">AF</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as <span class="ital">CD</span> is to <span class="ital">DE</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>, <a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>, <a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CD</span> has to <span class="ital">DE</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number: therefore also the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">AF</span> by the square on <span class="ital">BF</span> commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore there have been found two rational straight lines <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span> commensurable in square only and such that the square on the greater <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on the less <span class="ital">AF</span> by the square on <span class="ital">BF</span> commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>.<pb n="68"/></p>
