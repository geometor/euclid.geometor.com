<p><hi rend="ital">To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a rational rectangle</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a rational rectangle</span>. </p>

<p>Let two rational straight lines <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> commensurable in square only be set out; let <span class="ital">C</span> be taken a mean proportional between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.13">VI. 13</a>] and let it be contrived that, 
       <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are rational and commensurable in square only, the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">C</span> [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI.17</a>], is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">C</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23">X. 23</a>, addition] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are medial and commensurable in square only. </p>

<p>I say that they also contain a rational rectangle. </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, alternately, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>. <pb n="61"/></p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">B</span> is rational; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square only have been found which contain a rational rectangle. Q. E. D.</p>
