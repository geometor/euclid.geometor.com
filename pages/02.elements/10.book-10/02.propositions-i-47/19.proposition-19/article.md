<h1>PROPOSITION 19.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">The rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable in length is rational</span>. </p>

<p>For let the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span> be contained by the rational straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> commensurable in length; I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is rational. </p>

<p>For on <span class="ital">AB</span> let the square <span class="ital">AD</span> be described; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] 
      </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BD</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BD</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>. <pb n="48"/></p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">BD</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is <span class="ital">DA</span> to <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DA</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DA</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is also rational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
