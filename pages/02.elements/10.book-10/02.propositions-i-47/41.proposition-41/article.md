<h1>PROPOSITION 41.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial</span>, <span class="ital">and the rectangle contained by them medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them</span>, <span class="ital">be added together</span>, <span class="ital">the whole straight line is irrational</span>; <span class="ital">and let it be called the</span>
       <span class="bold">side of the sum of two medial areas</span>. <pb n="90"/></p>

<p>For let two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> incommensurable in square and satisfying the given conditions [<a href="/elem.10.35">X. 35</a>
] be added together; I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. 
      </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span> the rectangle <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">GH</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore the whole <span class="ital">DH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>Now, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, and is equal to <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DF</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>
] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">GK</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GF</span>, that is, <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">GH</span>; so that <span class="ital">DG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">GK</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>
, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] </p>

<p>And they are rational; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">DK</span> is irrational and what is called binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>
] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DE</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">DH</span> is irrational, and the side of the square which is equal to it is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AC</span> is the side of the square equal to <span class="ital">HD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>And let it be called the <span class="bold">side of the sum of two medial areas</span>. Q. E. D.

       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>And that the aforesaid irrational straight lines are divded only in one way into the straight lines of which they are the sum and which produce the types in question, we will now prove after premising the following lemma. </p>

       
<p>Let the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be set out, let the whole be cut into unequal parts at each of the points <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>,  and let <span class="ital">AC</span> be supposed greater than <span class="ital">DB</span>; I say that the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are greater than the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

       
<p>For let <span class="ital">AB</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

       
<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is greater than <span class="ital">DB</span>, let <span class="ital">DC</span> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">AD</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

       
<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DE</span> is less than <span class="ital">EC</span>; <pb n="92"/>therefore the points <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are not equidistant from the point of bisection. </p>

       
<p>And, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">EC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EB</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.5">II. 5</a>
] and, further, the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">DE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EB</span>, [<span class="ital">id</span>.] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">EC</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

       
<p>And of these the square on <span class="ital">DE</span> is less than the square on <span class="ital">EC</span>; therefore the remainder, the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, is also less than the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, so that twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is also less than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

       
<p>Therefore also the remainder, the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, is greater than the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. Q. E. D.
