<h1>PROPOSITION 3.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">Given two commensurable magnitudes, to find their greatest common measure</span>. </p>

<p>Let the two given commensurable magnitudes be <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> of which <span class="ital">AB</span> is the less; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Now the magnitude <span class="ital">AB</span> either measures <span class="ital">CD</span> or it does not. </p>

<p>If then it measures it—and it measures itself also—<span class="ital">AB</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude <span class="ital">AB</span> will not measure <span class="ital">AB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">AB</span> not measure <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Then, if the less be continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left over will sometime measure the one before it, because <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> are not incommensurable; [cf. <a href="/elem.10.2">X. 2</a>] let <span class="ital">AB</span>, measuring <span class="ital">ED</span>, leave <span class="ital">EC</span> less than itself, let <span class="ital">EC</span>, measuring <span class="ital">FB</span>, leave <span class="ital">AF</span> less than itself, and let <span class="ital">AF</span> measure <span class="ital">CE</span>. </p>

<p>Since, then, <span class="ital">AF</span> measures <span class="ital">CE</span>, while <span class="ital">CE</span> measures <span class="ital">FB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> will also measure <span class="ital">FB</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures itself also; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> will also measure the whole <span class="ital">AB</span>. <pb n="21"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> measures <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> will also measure <span class="ital">ED</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">CE</span> also; therefore it also measures the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is a common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>

<p>For, if not, there will be some magnitude greater than <span class="ital">AF</span> which will measure <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Let it be <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> measures <span class="ital">ED</span>, therefore <span class="ital">G</span> will also measure <span class="ital">ED</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures the whole <span class="ital">CD</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">CE</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CE</span> measures <span class="ital">FB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> will also measure <span class="ital">FB</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> also, and it will therefore measure the remainder <span class="ital">AF</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no magnitude greater than <span class="ital">AF</span> will measure <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the greatest common measure of the two given commensurable magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> has been found. Q. E. D. </p>
<div id="elem.10.3.p.1" class="porism">

<p>From this it is manifest that, if a magnitude measure two magnitudes, it will also measure their greatest common measure.</p>
