<p><hi rend="ital">A first bimedial straight line is divided at one point only</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A first bimedial straight line is divded at one point only</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a first bimedial straight line divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle;  I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not so divded at another point. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be divded at <span class="ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle. </p>

<p>Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is that by which the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> also differ from the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> by a rational area, though they are medial: which is absurd.

<p>Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divded into its terms at different points; therefore it is so divded at one point only.<pb n="95"/></p>
