       <span class="ital">To find two straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial but the rectangle contained by them rational.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be set out two medial straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, commensurable in square only, such that the rectangle which they contain is rational, and the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.31">X. 31</a>, <span class="ital">ad fin</span>.]  let the semicircle <span class="ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">BC</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="ital">AB</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span> and deficient by a square figure, namely the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.28">VI. 28</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">FD</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">F</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> be joined. <pb n="79"/></p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FB</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span> is also incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is medial, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>, <a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is also double of the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also rational. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>; [Lemma] so that the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Therefore two straight lines <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> incommensurable in square have been found which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. Q. E. D.</p>
