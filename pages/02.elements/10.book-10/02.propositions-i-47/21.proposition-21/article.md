       <span class="ital">The rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable in square only is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational. Let the latter be called</span>
       <span class="bold">medial.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span> be contained by the rational straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> commensurable in square only; <pb n="50"/>I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational; and let the latter be called <span class="bold">medial.</span>
      </p>

<p>For on <span class="ital">AB</span> let the square <span class="ital">AD</span> be described; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] 
      </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, for by hypothesis they are commensurable in square only, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BD</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DB</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is <span class="ital">AD</span> to <span class="ital">AC</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DA</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DA</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational, so that the side of the square equal to <span class="ital">AC</span> is also irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And let the latter be called <span class="bold">medial.</span> Q. E. D.</p>

<p>If there be two straight lines, then, as the first is to the second, so is the square on the first to the rectangle contained by the two straight lines. </p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span> be two straight lines. 
       </p>

       
<p>I say that, as <span class="ital">FE</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FE</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>. <pb n="51"/></p>

       
<p>For on <span class="ital">FE</span> let the square <span class="ital">DF</span> be described, and let <span class="ital">GD</span> be completed. </p>

       
<p>Since then, as <span class="ital">FE</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="ital">FD</span> to <span class="ital">DG</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and <span class="ital">FD</span> is the square on <span class="ital">FE</span>, and <span class="ital">DG</span> the rectangle <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">FE</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FE</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>. </p>

       
<p>Similarly also, as the rectangle <span class="ital">GE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>, that is, as <span class="ital">GD</span> is to <span class="ital">FD</span>, so is <span class="ital">GE</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>.
