<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial</span>, <span class="ital">but the rectangle contained by them rational</span>, <span class="ital">be added together, the whole straight line is irrational; and let it be called the</span>
       <span class="bold">side of a rational plus a medial area</span>. <pb n="89"/></p>

<p>For let two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the given conditions [<a href="/elem.10.34">X. 34</a>
], be added together; I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. 
      </p>

<p>For, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; so that the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is also incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>
] </p>

<p>But twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>And let it be called the <span class="bold">side of a rational plus a medial area</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
