<pb n="49"/><h1>PROPOSITION 20.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If a rational area be applied to a rational straight line, it produces as breadth a straight line rational and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is applied</span>. </p>

<p>For let the rational area <span class="ital">AC</span> be applied to <span class="ital">AB</span>, a straight line once more rational in any of the aforesaid ways, producing <span class="ital">BC</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BA</span>. For on <span class="ital">AB</span> let the square <span class="ital">AD</span> be described; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is rational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] 
      </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AC</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="ital">DA</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">DA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is <span class="ital">DB</span> to <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DB</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] and <span class="ital">DB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BA</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
