       <span class="ital">To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square only, containing a medial rectangle, and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater.</span>
       <pb n="72"/>
      </p>

<p>Let there be set out three rational straight lines <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> commensurable in square only, and such that the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">C</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">A</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.29">X. 29</a>] and let the square on <span class="ital">D</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Let the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Then since, as the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; while the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">D</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span> in square only; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">E</span> in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23">X. 23</a>, addition] </p>

<p>And, since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, while the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">C</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">A</span>, therefore also the square on <span class="ital">D</span> will be greater than the square on <span class="ital">E</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">D</span>.[<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>For, since the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, while the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is medial, [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>Therefore two medial straight lines <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, commensurable in square only, and containing a medial rectangle, have been found such that the square on the greater is greater than the <pb n="73"/>square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater. </p>
<div id="elem.10.32.p.1" class="porism">
       
<p>Similarly again it can be proved that the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">E</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">D</span>, when the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">C</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">A</span>.

       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>Let <span class="ital">ABC</span> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <span class="ital">A</span> right, and let the perpendicular <span class="ital">AD</span> be drawn; I say that the rectangle <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BA</span>, the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>, the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>, and, further, the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>. 
        <pb n="75"/></p>

       
<p>And first that the rectangle <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BA</span>. </p>

       
<p>For, since in a right-angled triangle <span class="ital">AD</span> has been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base, therefore the triangles <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">ADC</span> are similar both to the whole <span class="ital">ABC</span> and to one another. [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>] </p>

       
<p>And since the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">CB</span> is to <span class="ital">BA</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">BD</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

       
<p>For the same reason the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

       
<p>And since, if in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base, the perpendicular so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the base, [<a href="/elem.6.8.p.1">VI. 8, Por.</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">BD</span> is to <span class="ital">DA</span>, so is <span class="ital">AD</span> to <span class="ital">DC</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

       
<p>I say that the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> is also equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

       
<p>For since, as we said, <span class="ital">ABC</span> is similar to <span class="ital">ABD</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CA</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">AD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

       
<p>Therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.16">VI. 16</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
