<h1>PROPOSITION 47.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">The side of the sum of two medial areas is divded at one point only</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <pb n="100"/><span class="ital">CB</span> medial, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not divded at another point so as to fulfil the given conditions. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be divded at <span class="ital">D</span>, so that again <span class="ital">AC</span> is of course not the same as <span class="ital">BD</span>, but <span class="ital">AC</span> is supposed greater; let a rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span> the rectangle <span class="ital">EG</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">HK</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore the whole <span class="ital">EK</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>Again, let <span class="ital">EL</span>, equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, is equal to the remainder <span class="ital">MK</span>. </p>

<p>And since, by hypothesis, the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is medial, therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">HE</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>
] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">HN</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">GN</span>, so that <span class="ital">EH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">HN</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>
, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] </p>

<p>And they are rational; <pb n="101"/>therefore <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HN</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EN</span> is a binomial straight line divded at <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>
] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that it is also divded at <span class="ital">M.</span>
      </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EH</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">MN</span>; therefore a binomial has been divded at different points: which is absurd. [<a href="/elem.10.42">X. 42</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore a side of the sum of two medial areas is not divded at different points; therefore it is divded at one point only.</p>
