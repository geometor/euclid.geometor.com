<p><hi rend="ital">If four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be commensurable with the second, the third will also be commensurable with the fourth; and, if the first be incommensurable with the second, the third will also be incommensurable with the fourth</hi>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">If four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be commensurable with the second, the third will also be commensurable with the fourth; and, if the first be incommensurable with the second, the third will also be incommensurable with the fourth</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be four magnitudes in proportion, so that, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">A</span> be commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>;  I say that <span class="ital">C</span> will also be commensurable with <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/elem.10.5">X. 5</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> also has to <span class="ital">D</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span> be incommensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> will also be incommensurable with <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has not to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/elem.10.7">X. 7</a>] <pb n="34"/></p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore neither has <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.8">X. 8</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
