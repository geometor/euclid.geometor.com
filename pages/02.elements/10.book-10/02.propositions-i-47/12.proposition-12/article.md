<h1>PROPOSITION 12.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">Magnitudes commensurable with the same magnitude are commensurable with one another also</span>. </p>

<p>For let each of the magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">C</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/elem.10.5">X. 5</a>] <pb n="35"/></p>

<p>Let it have the ratio which <span class="ital">D</span> has to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">C</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/elem.10.5">X. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Let it have the ratio which <span class="ital">F</span> has to <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the ratio which <span class="ital">D</span> has to <span class="ital">E</span> and that which <span class="ital">F</span> has to <span class="ital">G</span>, let the numbers <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> be taken continuously in the given ratios; [cf. <a href="/elem.8.4">VIII. 4</a>] so that, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="center">and, as <span class="ital">F</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Since, then, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, while, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>, therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, while, as <span class="ital">F</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>, therefore also, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
