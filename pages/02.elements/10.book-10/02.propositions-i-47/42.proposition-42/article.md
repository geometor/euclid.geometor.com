<p>A binomial straight line is divided into its terms at one point only.</p>

===

<h1>PROPOSITION 42.</h1>
<p>A binomial straight line is divded into its terms at one point only.</p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a binomial straight line divded into its terms at <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>
] 
      </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not divded at another point into two rational straight lines commensurable in square only. <pb n="93"/></p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be divded at <span class="ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>

<p>It is then manifest that <span class="ital">AC</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be so. </p>

<p>Then <span class="ital">AD</span> will also be the same as <span class="ital">CB</span>, and, as <span class="ital">AC</span> is to <span class="ital">CB</span>, so will <span class="ital">BD</span> be to <span class="ital">DA</span>; thus <span class="ital">AB</span> will be divded at <span class="ital">D</span> also in the same way as by the divsion at <span class="ital">C</span>: which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

<p>For this reason also the points <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are not equidistant from the point of bisection. </p>

<p>Therefore that by which the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also that by which twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, because both the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> together with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, and the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> together with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, are equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> by a rational area, for both are rational; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> also differs from twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area, though they are medial [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>
]: which is absurd, for a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [<a href="/elem.10.26">x. 26</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore a binomial straight line is not divded at different points; therefore it is divded at one point only. Q. E. D.</p>
