<p><hi rend="ital">If two incommensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them; and, if the whole be incommensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two incommensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them; and, if the whole be incommensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable</span>. </p>

<p>For let the two incommensurable magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be added together; I say that the whole <span class="ital">AC</span> is also incommensurable with each of the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are not incommensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>

<p>Let it measure them, if possible, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">BC</span>. 
      </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">AB</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no magnitude will measure <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are incommensurable. [<a href="/elem.10.def.1">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are also incommensurable. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable with each of the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">AC</span> be incommensurable with one of the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>First, let it be incommensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also incommensurable. </p>

<p>For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>

<p>Let it measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. therefore it will also measure the whole <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">AB</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>. <pb n="41"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no magnitude will measure <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are incommensurable. [<a href="/elem.10.def.1">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
<div id="elem.10.16.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>
        <span class="ital">If to any straight line there be applied a parallelogram deficient by a square figure, the applied parallelogram is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the straight line resulting from the application.</span>
       </p>

       
<p>For let there be applied to the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> the parallelogram <span class="ital">AD</span> deficient by the square figure <span class="ital">DB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. 
       </p>

       
<p>This is indeed at once manifest; for, since <span class="ital">DB</span> is a square, <span class="ital">DC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CB</span>; and <span class="ital">AD</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

       
<p>Therefore etc.</p>
