<h1>PROPOSITION 45.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">A major straight line is divded at one and the same point only</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a major straight line divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> rational, but the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> medial; [<a href="/elem.10.39">X. 39</a>
]  I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not so divded at another point. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be divded at <span class="ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. </p>

<p>Then, since that by which the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also that by which twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, while the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> exceed the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> also exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> by a rational area, though they are medial: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.10.26">X. 26</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore a major straight line is not divded at different points; therefore it is only divded at one and the same point. Q. E. D.</p>
