<p><span class="ital">If four straight lines be proportional, and the square on the first be greater than the square on the second by the square on a straight line commensurable with the first, the square on the third will also be greater than the square on the fourth by</span>
       <lb n="5"/><span class="ital">the square on a straight line commensurable with the third</span>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">And, if the square on the first be greater than the square on the second by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the first, the square on the third will also be greater than the square on the fourth by the square on a straight line in-</span>
       <lb n="10"/><span class="ital">commensurable with the third</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; and let the square on <span class="ital">A</span> be greater than the square on <span class="ital">B</span> by the square on <span class="ital">E</span>, and <lb n="15"/>let the square on <span class="ital">C</span> be greater than the square on <span class="ital">D</span> by the square on <span class="ital">F</span>; I say that, if <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">F</span>, and, if <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is <lb n="20"/>also incommensurable with <span class="ital">F</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">C</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.22">VI. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>, <lb n="25"/>and the squares on <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">C</span>. <pb n="38"/></p>

<p>Therefore, as the squares on <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, so are the squares on <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, as the square on <span class="ital">E</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">F</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.17">V. 17</a>] <lb n="30"/>therefore also, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.22">VI. 22</a>] therefore, inversely, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so also is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, if <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is also commensurable<lb n="35"/> with <span class="ital">F</span>, and, if <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.<blockquote class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">3, 5, 8, 10. Euclid speaks of the square on the first (third) being greater than the square on the second (fourth) by the square on a straight line commensurable (incommensurable) <quote>with <span class="ital">itself</span> (<foreign lang="greek">ἑαυτῇ</foreign>),</quote>
 and similarly in all like phrases throughout the Book. For clearness' sake I substitute <quote>the first,</quote>
 <quote>the third,</quote>
 or whatever it may be, for <quote>itself</quote>
 in these cases.</blockquote></p>
