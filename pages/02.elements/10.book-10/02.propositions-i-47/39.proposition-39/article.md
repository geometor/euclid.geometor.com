<h1>PROPOSITION 39.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial, be added together, the whole straight line is irrational : and let it be called</span>
       <span class="bold">major</span>. <pb n="88"/></p>

<p>For let two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the given conditions [<a href="/elem.10.33">X. 33</a>
], be added together; I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. 
      </p>

<p>For, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.6 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 6
 and 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>But the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, so that the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> that is, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, is also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>
] therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is also irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>And let it be called <span class="bold">major</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
