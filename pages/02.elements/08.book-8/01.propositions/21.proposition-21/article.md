<h1>PROPOSITION 21.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If two mean proportional numbers fall between two numbers, the numbers are similar solid numbers.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let two mean proportional numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> fall between the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar solid numbers. 
      </p>

<p>For let three numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a> or <a href="/elem.8.2">VIII. 2</a>] therefore the extremes of them <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.8.3">VIII. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since one mean proportional number <span class="ital">F</span> has fallen between <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are similar plane numbers. [<a href="/elem.8.20">VIII. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Let, then, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> be the sides of <span class="ital">E</span>, and <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> of <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore it is manifest from the theorem before this that <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">L</span> and that of <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">M</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, and the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio with <pb n="378"/>them the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Now, as many times as <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">N</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">N</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span> is the product of <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore <span class="ital">N</span> by multiplying the product of <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is solid, and <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">N</span> are its sides. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio as <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Now, as many times as <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">O</span>; therefore <span class="ital">O</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">G</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">G</span> is the product of <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>; therefore <span class="ital">O</span> by multiplying the product of <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is solid, and <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> are its sides; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are solid. </p>

<p>I say that they are also similar. </p>

<p>For since <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> have made <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">N</span> is to <span class="ital">O</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>, that is, <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.18">VII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">L</span> and <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">M</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">H</span> is to <span class="ital">L</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">M</span> and <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">N</span> are the sides of <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> the sides of <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar solid numbers. Q. E. D.</p>
