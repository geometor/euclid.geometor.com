<p>
       <span class="ital">Plane numbers have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be plane numbers, and let the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be the sides of <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> of <span class="ital">B</span>; <lb n="5"/>I say that <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. 
      </p>

<p>For, the ratios being given which <span class="ital">C</span> has to <span class="ital">E</span> and <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>, let the least numbers <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> that are continuously <lb n="10"/>in the ratios <span class="ital">C</span> : <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> : <span class="ital">F</span> be taken, so that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>,</span> and, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.4">VIII. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And let <span class="ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> make <span class="ital">L</span>. <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">L</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">G</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. <lb n="20"/></p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">L</span>, and further by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">L</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">H</span> is to <span class="ital">K</span>, so is <span class="ital">L</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>But it was also proved that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">G</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>;</span> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">G</span> is to <span class="ital">K</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">G</span> has to <span class="ital">K</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the <lb n="30"/>sides; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. Q. E. D.
