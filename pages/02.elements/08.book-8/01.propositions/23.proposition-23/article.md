       <hi rend="ital">If four numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be cube, the fourth will also be cube.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If four numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be cube, the fourth will also be cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be four numbers in continued proportion, and let <span class="ital">A</span> be cube; I say that <span class="ital">D</span> is also cube. 
      </p>

<p>For, since between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> there are two mean proportional numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are similar solid numbers. [<a href="/elem.8.21">VIII. 21</a>] <pb n="380"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> is cube; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also cube. Q. E. D.</p>
