<p><hi rend="ital">If as many numbers as we please in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, the extremes of them are prime to one another</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, the extremes of them are prime to one another</span>. </p>

<p>Let as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; 
       <pb n="349"/>I say that the extremes of them <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>For let two numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, the least that are in the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, be taken, [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a>] then three others <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> with the same property; and others, more by one continually, [<a href="/elem.8.2">VIII. 2</a>] until the multitude taken becomes equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Let them be taken, and let them be <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, they are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.7.22">VII. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the numbers <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying themselves respectively have made the numbers <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, and by multiplying the numbers <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> respectively have made the numbers <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, [<a href="/elem.8.2.p.1">VIII. 2, Por.</a>] therefore both <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> and <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.7.27">VII. 27</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, while <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> are the least that are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, and the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, therefore the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are equal to the numbers <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> respectively; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is equal to <span class="ital">L</span>, and <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are also prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
