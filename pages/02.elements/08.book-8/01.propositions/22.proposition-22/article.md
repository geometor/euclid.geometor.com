<h1>PROPOSITION 22.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If three numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be square, the third will also be square.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be three numbers in continued proportion, and let <span class="ital">A</span> the first be square; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> the third is also square. 
      </p>

<p>For, since between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> there is one mean proportional number, <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are similar plane numbers. [<a href="/elem.8.20">VIII. 20</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> is square; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is also square. Q. E. D.</p>
