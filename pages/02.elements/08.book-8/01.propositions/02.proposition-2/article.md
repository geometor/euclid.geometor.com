       <hi rend="ital">To find numbers in continued proportion, as many as may be prescribed, and the least that are in a given ratio.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">To find numbers in continued proportion, as many as may be prescribed, and the least that are in a given ratio.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span> be the given ratio in least numbers; thus it is required to find numbers in continued proportion, as many as may be prescribed, and the least that are in the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let four be prescribed; let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">C</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> let it make <span class="ital">D</span>; let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">E</span>; further, let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> make <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, and let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> make <span class="ital">K</span>. <pb n="347"/></p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">C</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> have made the numbers <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> respectively. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.18">VII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so was <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> have made <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.18">VII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <span class="ital">F</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>, and <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, and <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> are proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that they are the least numbers that are so. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, and the least of those which have the same ratio are prime to one another, [<a href="/elem.7.22">VII. 22</a>] therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>And the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying themselves respectively have made the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, and by multiplying the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> respectively have made the numbers <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> and <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> are prime to one another respectively. [<a href="/elem.7.27">VII. 27</a>] </p>

<p>But, if there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the extremes of them be prime to one another, <pb n="348"/>they are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. [<a href="/elem.8.1">VIII. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> and <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. Q. E. D. </p>
<div id="elem.8.2.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
       
<p>From this it is manifest that, if three numbers in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, the extremes of them are squares, and, if four numbers, cubes.</p>
