       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.</hi>

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the cube number <span class="ital">C</span> has to the cube number <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">A</span> be cube; I say that <span class="ital">B</span> is also cube. <pb n="381"/></p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are cube, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are similar solid numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.19">VIII. 19</a>] 
      </p>

<p>And, as many numbers as fall between <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> in continued proportion, so many will also fall between those which have the same ratio with them; [<a href="/elem.8.8">VIII. 8</a>] so that two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> so fall. </p>

<p>Since, then, the four numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="ital">A</span> is cube, therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is also cube.
