<h1>PROPOSITION 24.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and the first be square, the second will also be square.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the square number <span class="ital">C</span> has to the square number <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">A</span> be square; I say that <span class="ital">B</span> is also square. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are square, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are similar plane numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore one mean proportional number falls between <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore one mean proportional number falls between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> also. [<a href="/elem.8.8">VIII. 8</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">A</span> is square; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is also square. [<a href="/elem.8.22">VIII. 22</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
