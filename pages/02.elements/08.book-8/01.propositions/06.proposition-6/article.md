       <hi rend="ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the first do not measure the second, neither will any other measure any other.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the first do not measure the second, neither will any other measure any other.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, in continued proportion, and let <span class="ital">A</span> not measure <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that neither will any other measure any other. 
      </p>

<p>Now it is manifest that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> do not measure one another in order; for <span class="ital">A</span> does not even measure <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>I say, then, that neither will any other measure any other. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">A</span> measure <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>And, however many <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are, let as many numbers <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, be taken. [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, and the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>] <pb n="356"/></p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, while <span class="ital">A</span> does not measure <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore neither does <span class="ital">F</span> measure <span class="ital">G</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">F</span> is not an unit, for the unit measures any number. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.8.3">VIII. 3</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">F</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore neither does <span class="ital">A</span> measure <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither will any other measure any other. Q. E. D.</p>
