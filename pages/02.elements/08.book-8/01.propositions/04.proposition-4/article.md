<h1>PROPOSITION 4.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Given as many ratios as we please in least numbers, to find numbers in continued proportion which are the least in the given ratios.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the given ratios in least numbers be that of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, <lb n="5"/>that of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and that of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>; thus it is required to find numbers in continued proportion which are the least that are in the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and in the ratio of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">G</span>, the least number measured by <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, be taken. [<a href="/elem.7.34">VII. 34</a>] <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">G</span>, so many times also let <span class="ital">A</span> measure <span class="ital">H</span>, and, as many times as <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">G</span>, so many times also let <span class="ital">D</span> measure <span class="ital">K</span>. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">E</span> either measures or does not measure <span class="ital">K</span>. <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>First, let it measure it. </p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">K</span>, so many times let <span class="ital">F</span> measure <span class="ital">L</span> also. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">H</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">G</span>, <lb n="20"/>therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20 elem.7.13">VII. Def. 20, VII. 13</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason also, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>,</span> and further, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>; therefore <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are continuously proportional in the <lb n="25"/>ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and in the ratio of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that they are also the least that have this property. <pb n="351"/></p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are not the least numbers continuously <lb n="30"/>proportional in the ratios of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>, let them be <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>. </p>

<p>Then since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>, while <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same <lb n="35"/>ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">O</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <lb n="40"/><span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">O</span>; therefore <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">O</span>; therefore the least number measured by <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will also measure <span class="ital">O</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">G</span> is the least number measured by <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; <lb n="45"/>therefore <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">O</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore there will be no numbers less than <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> which are continuously in the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. <lb n="50"/></p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">E</span> not measure <span class="ital">K</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">M</span>, the least number measured by <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, be taken. </p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">K</span> measures <span class="ital">M</span>, so many times let <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> measure <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> respectively, and, as many times as <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">M</span>, so many times let <span class="ital">F</span>
       <lb n="55"/>measure <span class="ital">P</span> also. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">H</span> measures <span class="ital">N</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">O</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">H</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.13 elem.7.def.20">VII. 13 and Def. 20</a>] <pb n="352"/></p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">H</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; <lb n="60"/>therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason also, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">O</span> to <span class="ital">M</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">M</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">P</span>, <lb n="65"/>therefore, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">M</span> to <span class="ital">P</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.13 elem.7.def.20">VII. 13 and Def. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">P</span> are continuously proportional in the ratios of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that they are also the least that are in the ratios <span class="ital">A</span> : <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> : <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> : <span class="ital">F</span>. <lb n="70"/></p>

<p>For, if not, there will be some numbers less than <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">P</span> continuously proportional in the ratios <span class="ital">A</span> : <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> : <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> : <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Let them be <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">R</span>, <span class="ital">S</span>, <span class="ital">T</span>. </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">Q</span> is to <span class="ital">R</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, <lb n="75"/>while <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are least, and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">R</span>. <lb n="80"/></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">R</span>; therefore <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">R</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the least number measured by <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> will also measure <span class="ital">R</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">G</span> is the least number measured by <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; <lb n="85"/>therefore <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">R</span>. </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">G</span> is to <span class="ital">R</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">S</span>: [<a href="/elem.7.13">VII. 13</a>] therefore <span class="ital">K</span> also measures <span class="ital">S</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">E</span> also measures <span class="ital">S</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> measure <span class="ital">S</span>. <lb n="90"/></p>

<p>Therefore the least number measured by <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> will also measure <span class="ital">S</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">M</span> is the least number measured by <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore <span class="ital">M</span> measures <span class="ital">S</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. <lb n="95"/></p>

<p>Therefore there will not be any numbers less than <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">P</span> continuously proportional in the ratios of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>; <pb n="353"/>therefore <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">P</span> are the least numbers continuously proportional in the ratios <span class="ital">A</span> : <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> : <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> : <span class="ital">F</span>.
