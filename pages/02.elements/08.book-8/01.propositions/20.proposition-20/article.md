<h1>PROPOSITION 20.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If one mean proportional number fall between two numbers, the numbers will be similar plane numbers.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let one mean proportional number <span class="ital">C</span> fall between the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; <lb n="5"/>I say that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a>] therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>Now, as many times as <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>, so that <span class="ital">A</span> is plane, and <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are its sides. <pb n="376"/></p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are the least of the numbers which have <lb n="15"/>the same ratio with <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] 
      </p>

<p>As many times, then, as <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">G</span>; <lb n="20"/>therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">G</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is plane, and <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> are its sides. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are plane numbers. </p>

<p>I say next that they are also similar. <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>For, &lt;*&gt; since <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>, that is, <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Again, &lt;*&gt; since <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> respectively, <lb n="30"/>therefore, as <span class="ital">F</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>And alternately, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.13">VII. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers; for their sides <lb n="35"/>are proportional. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="25, 27" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
        
<p>25. <lemma from="ROOT" to="DITTO">For, since F</lemma>......27. <lemma from="ROOT" to="DITTO">C to B.</lemma> The text has clearly suffered corruption here. It is not necessary to <span class="ital">infer</span> from other facts that, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; for this is part of the hypotheses (ll. 6, 7). Again, there is no explanation of the statement (l. 25) that <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. It is the statement and explanation of this latter fact which are alone wanted; after which the proof proceeds as in l. 28. We might therefore substitute for ll. 25-28 the following.</p>

        
<p>“For, since <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> [l. 8], that is, according to the units in <span class="ital">F</span> [l. 10], therefore <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

        
<p>And, since <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>,”
 etc. etc.</p>
