<h1>PROPOSITION 14.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a square measure a square, the side will also measure the side; and, if the side measure the side, the square will also measure the square.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be square numbers, let <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be their sides, and let <span class="ital">A</span> measure <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> make <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.11">VIII. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional, and <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.7">VIII. 7</a>] <pb n="368"/></p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore also <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Again, let <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can in a similar manner prove that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, and <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
