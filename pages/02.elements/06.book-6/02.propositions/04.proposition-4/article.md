<h1>PROPOSITION 4.</h1>
<p><em>In equiangular triangles the sides about the equal angles are proportional</em>, <em>and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles</em>. <pb n="201"/></p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DCE</em> be equiangular triangles having the angle <em>ABC</em> equal to the angle <em>DCE</em>, the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>CDE</em>, and further the angle <em>ACB</em> to the angle <em>CED</em>; I say that in the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>DCE</em> the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>BC</em> be placed in a straight line with <em>CE</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ACB</em> are less than two right angles, [<a href="/elem.1.17">I. 17</a>] and the angle <em>ACB</em> is equal to the angle <em>DEC</em>, therefore the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEC</em> are less than two right angles; therefore <em>BA</em>, <em>ED</em>, when produced, will meet. [<a href="/elem.1.post.5">I. Post. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Let them be produced and meet at <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since the angle <em>DCE</em> is equal to the angle <em>ABC</em>, <span class="center"><em>BF</em> is parallel to <em>CD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.28">I. 28</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since the angle <em>ACB</em> is equal to the angle <em>DEC</em>, <span class="center"><em>AC</em> is parallel to <em>FE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.28">I. 28</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>FACD</em> is a parallelogram; therefore <em>FA</em> is equal to <em>DC</em>, and <em>AC</em> to <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <em>AC</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>FE</em>, one side of the triangle <em>FBE</em>, therefore, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AF</em>, so is <em>BC</em> to <em>CE</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>BC</em> to <em>CE</em>,</span> and alternately, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>DC</em> to <em>CE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <em>CD</em> is parallel to <em>BF</em>, therefore, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CE</em>, so is <em>FD</em> to <em>DE</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>FD</em> is equal to <em>AC</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CE</em>, so is <em>AC</em> to <em>DE</em>,</span> and alternately, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CA</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>ED</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] <pb n="202"/></p>

<p>Since then it was proved that, <span class="center">as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>DC</em> to <em>CE</em>,</span> and, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CA</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>ED</em>; therefore, <em>ex aequali</em>, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so is <em>CD</em> to <em>DE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
