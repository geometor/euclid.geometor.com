<h1>PROPOSITION 17</h1>
<p><em>If three straight lines be proportional</em>, <em>the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the square on the mean</em>; <em>and</em>, <em>if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the square on the mean</em>, <em>the three straight lines will be proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let the three straight lines <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> be proportional, so that, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>; I say that the rectangle contained by <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> is equal to the square on <em>B</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <em>D</em> be made equal to <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>, and <em>B</em> is equal to <em>D</em>, therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>But, if four straight lines be proportional, the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means. [<a href="/elem.6.16">VI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the rectangle <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> is equal to the rectangle <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>But the rectangle <em>B</em>, <em>D</em> is the square on <em>B</em>, for <em>B</em> is equal to <em>D</em>; therefore the rectangle contained by <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> is equal to the square on <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>Next, let the rectangle <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> be equal to the square on <em>B</em>; I say that, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>. <pb n="229"/></p>

<p>For, with the same construction, since the rectangle <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> is equal to the square on <em>B</em>, while the square on <em>B</em> is the rectangle <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>, for <em>B</em> is equal to <em>D</em>, therefore the rectangle <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> is equal to the rectangle <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>But, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to that contained by the means, the four straight lines are proportional. [<a href="/elem.6.16">VI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>B</em> is equal to <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
