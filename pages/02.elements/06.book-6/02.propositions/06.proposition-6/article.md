<h1>PROPOSITION 6.</h1>
<p><em>If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional</em>, <em>the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> be two triangles having one angle <em>BAC</em> equal to one angle <em>EDF</em> and the sides about the equal angles proportional, so that, <span class="center">as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so is <em>ED</em> to <em>DF</em>;</span> I say that the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>, and will have the angle <em>ABC</em> equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>, and the angle <em>ACB</em> to the angle <em>DFE</em>. </p>

<p>For on the straight line <em>DF</em>, and at the points <em>D</em>, <em>F</em> on it, let there be constructed the angle <em>FDG</em> equal to either of the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>EDF</em>, and the angle <em>DFG</em> equal to the angle <em>ACB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] <span class="center">therefore the remaining angle at <em>B</em> is equal to the remaining angle at <em>G</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>]</span>
       <pb n="205"/></p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DGF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so is <em>GD</em> to <em>DF</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so also is <em>ED</em> to <em>DF</em>; therefore also, as <em>ED</em> is to <em>DF</em>, so is <em>GD</em> to <em>DF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>ED</em> is equal to <em>DG</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] and <em>DF</em> is common; <span class="center">therefore the two sides <em>ED</em>, <em>DF</em> are equal to the two sides <em>GD</em>, <em>DF</em>; and the angle <em>EDF</em> is equal to the angle <em>GDF</em>; therefore the base <em>EF</em> is equal to the base <em>GF</em>, and the triangle <em>DEF</em> is equal to the triangle <em>DGF</em>,</span> and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>DFG</em> is equal to the angle <em>DFE</em>, <span class="center">and the angle <em>DGF</em> to the angle <em>DEF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>DFG</em> is equal to the angle <em>ACB</em>; therefore the angle <em>ACB</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DFE</em>. </p>

<p>And, by hypothesis, the angle <em>BAC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>EDF</em>; therefore the remaining angle at <em>B</em> is also equal to the remaining angle at <em>E</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] <span class="center">therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
