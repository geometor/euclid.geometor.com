<p><emph>To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line, <em>C</em> the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to <em>AB</em> is required to be equal, and <em>D</em> that to which the excess is required to be similar; thus it is required to apply to the straight line <em>AB</em> a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure <em>C</em> and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to <em>D</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be bisected at <em>E</em>; let there be described on <em>EB</em> the parallelogram <em>BF</em> similar and similarly situated to <em>D</em>; and let <em>GH</em> be constructed at once equal to the sum of <em>BF</em>, <em>C</em> and similar and similarly situated to <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.25">VI. 25</a>] </p>

<p>Let <em>KH</em> correspond to <em>FL</em> and <em>KG</em> to <em>FE</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since <em>GH</em> is greater than <em>FB</em>, therefore <em>KH</em> is also greater than <em>FL</em>, and <em>KG</em> than <em>FE</em>. <pb n="266"/></p>

<p>Let <em>FL</em>, <em>FE</em> be produced, let <em>FLM</em> be equal to <em>KH</em>, and <em>FEN</em> to <em>KG</em>, and let <em>MN</em> be completed; <span class="center">therefore <em>MN</em> is both equal and similar to <em>GH</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>GH</em> is similar to <em>EL</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>MN</em> is also similar to <em>EL</em>; [<a href="/elem.6.21">VI. 21</a>]</span> therefore <em>EL</em> is about the same diameter with <em>MN</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Let their diameter <em>FO</em> be drawn, and let the figure be described. </p>

<p>Since <em>GH</em> is equal to <em>EL</em>, <em>C</em>, while <em>GH</em> is equal to <em>MN</em>, therefore <em>MN</em> is also equal to <em>EL</em>, <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>EL</em> be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore the remainder, the gnomon <em>XWV</em>, is equal to <em>C</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Now, since <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>EB</em>, <span class="center"><em>AN</em> is also equal to <em>NB</em> [<a href="/elem.1.36">I. 36</a>], that is, to <em>LP</em> [<a href="/elem.1.43">I. 43</a>].</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <em>EO</em> be added to each; <span class="center">therefore the whole <em>AO</em> is equal to the gnomon <em>VWX</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the gnomon <em>VWX</em> is equal to <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AO</em> is also equal to <em>C</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore to the given straight line <em>AB</em> there has been applied the parallelogram <em>AO</em> equal to the given rectilineal figure <em>C</em> and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure <em>QP</em> which is similar to <em>D</em>, since <em>PQ</em> is also similar to <em>EL</em> [<a href="/elem.6.24">VI. 24</a>].
