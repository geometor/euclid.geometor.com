<p><emph>In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter are similar both to the whole and to one another</emph>. </p>

===

<h1>PROPOSITION 24.</h1>
<p><em>In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter are similar both to the whole and to one another</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a parallelogram, and <em>AC</em> its diameter, and let <em>EG</em>, <em>HK</em> be parallelograms about <em>AC</em>; I say that each of the parallelograms <em>EG</em>, <em>HK</em> is similar both to the whole <em>ABCD</em> and to the other. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <em>EF</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>BC</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>ABC</em>, <span class="center">proportionally, as <em>BE</em> is to <em>EA</em>, so is <em>CF</em> to <em>FA</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>FG</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>CD</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>ACD</em>, <span class="center">proportionally, as <em>CF</em> is to <em>FA</em>, so is <em>DG</em> to <em>GA</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was proved that, <span class="center">as <em>CF</em> is to <em>FA</em>, so also is <em>BE</em> to <em>EA</em>; therefore also, as <em>BE</em> is to <em>EA</em>, so is <em>DG</em> to <em>GA</em>,</span> and therefore, <em>componendo</em>, <span class="center">as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AE</em>, so is <em>DA</em> to <em>AG</em>, [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>]</span> and, alternately, <span class="center">as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AD</em>, so is <em>EA</em> to <em>AG</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelograms <em>ABCD</em>, <em>EG</em>, the sides about the common angle <em>BAD</em> are proportional. </p>

<p>And, since <em>GF</em> is parallel to <em>DC</em>, <pb n="252"/><span class="center">the angle <em>AFG</em> is equal to the angle <em>DCA</em>;</span> and the angle <em>DAC</em> is common to the two triangles <em>ADC</em>, <em>AGF</em>; <span class="center">therefore the triangle <em>ADC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>AGF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the triangle <em>ACB</em> is also equiangular with the triangle <em>AFE</em>,</span> and the whole parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is equiangular with the parallelogram <em>EG</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, <span class="center">as <em>AD</em> is to <em>DC</em>, so is <em>AG</em> to <em>GF</em>, as <em>DC</em> is to <em>CA</em>, so is <em>GF</em> to <em>FA</em>, as <em>AC</em> is to <em>CB</em>, so is <em>AF</em> to <em>FE</em>,</span> and further, as <em>CB</em> is to <em>BA</em>, so is <em>FE</em> to <em>EA</em>. </p>

<p>And, since it was proved that, <span class="center">as <em>DC</em> is to <em>CA</em>, so is <em>GF</em> to <em>FA</em>,</span> and, as <em>AC</em> is to <em>CB</em>, so is <em>AF</em> to <em>FE</em>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <em>DC</em> is to <em>CB</em>, so is <em>GF</em> to <em>FE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelograms <em>ABCD</em>, <em>EG</em> the sides about the equal angles are proportional; therefore the parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is similar to the parallelogram <em>EG</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason the parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is also similar to the parallelogram <em>KH</em>; therefore each of the parallelograms <em>EG</em>, <em>HK</em> is similar to <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>But figures similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another; [<a href="/elem.6.21">VI. 21</a>] therefore the parallelogram <em>EG</em> is also similar to the parallelogram <em>HK</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
