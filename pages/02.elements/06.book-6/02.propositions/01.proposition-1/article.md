<p><emph>Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height are to one another as their bases</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height are to one another as their bases</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>ACD</em> be triangles and <em>EC</em>, <em>CF</em> parallelograms under the same height; <lb n="5"/>I say that, as the base <em>BC</em> is to the base <em>CD</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABC</em> to the triangle <em>ACD</em>, and the parallelogram <em>EC</em> to the parallelogram <em>CF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>BD</em> be produced in both directions to the points <em>H</em>, <em>L</em> and let [any number of straight lines] <em>BG</em>, <em>GH</em> be <lb n="10"/>made equal to the base <em>BC</em>, and any number of straight lines <em>DK</em>, <em>KL</em> equal to the base <em>CD</em>; let <em>AG</em>, <em>AH</em>, <em>AK</em>, <em>AL</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>CB</em>, <em>BG</em>, <em>GH</em> are equal to one another, <span class="center">the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>AGB</em>, <em>AHG</em> are also equal to one <lb n="15"/>another. [<a href="/elem.1.38">I. 38</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <em>HC</em> is of the base <em>BC</em>, that multiple also is the triangle <em>AHC</em> of the triangle <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason, <lb n="20"/>whatever multiple the base <em>LC</em> is of the base <em>CD</em>, that multiple also is the triangle <em>ALC</em> of the triangle <em>ACD</em>; and, if the base <em>HC</em> is equal to the base <em>CL</em>, the triangle <em>AHC</em> is also equal to the triangle <em>ACL</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.38">I. 38</a>] <pb n="192"/>if the base <em>HC</em> is in excess of the base <em>CL</em>, the triangle <em>AHC</em>
       <lb n="25"/>is also in excess of the triangle <em>ACL</em>, and, if less, less. </p>

<p>Thus, there being four magnitudes, two bases <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em> and two triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ACD</em>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <em>BC</em> and the <lb n="30"/>triangle <em>ABC</em>, namely the base <em>HC</em> and the triangle <em>AHC</em>, and of the base <em>CD</em> and the triangle <em>ADC</em> other, chance, equimultiples, namely the base <em>LC</em> and the triangle <em>ALC</em>; <span class="center">and it has been proved that,</span> if the base <em>HC</em> is in excess of the base <em>CL</em>, the triangle <em>AHC</em>
       <lb n="35"/>is also in excess of the triangle <em>ALC</em>; if equal, equal; and, if less, less. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the base <em>BC</em> is to the base <em>CD</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABC</em> to the triangle <em>ACD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Next, since the parallelogram <em>EC</em> is double of the triangle <lb n="40"/><em>ABC</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.41">I. 41</a>] and the parallelogram <em>FC</em> is double of the triangle <em>ACD</em>, while parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>] therefore, as the triangle <em>ABC</em> is to the triangle <em>ACD</em>, so is <lb n="45"/>the parallelogram <em>EC</em> to the parallelogram <em>FC</em>. </p>

<p>Since, then, it was proved that, as the base <em>BC</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABC</em> to the triangle <em>ACD</em>, and, as the triangle <em>ABC</em> is to the triangle <em>ACD</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>EC</em> to the parallelogram <em>CF</em>, <lb n="50"/>therefore also, as the base <em>BC</em> is to the base <em>CD</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>EC</em> to the parallelogram <em>FC</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

 But, even if the two triangles are placed contiguously so as to have a common side <em>AC</em>, it is quite gratuitous to require it to be perpendicular to the base.

 I have ventured to alter so far as to omit <quote><em>AC</em></quote>
