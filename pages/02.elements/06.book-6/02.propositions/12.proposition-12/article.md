<p><emph>To three given straight lines to find a fourth proportional</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To three given straight lines to find a fourth proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> be the three given straight lines; thus it is required to find a fourth proportional to <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let two straight lines <em>DE</em>, <em>DF</em> be set out containing any angle <em>EDF</em>; let <em>DG</em> be made equal to <em>A</em>, <em>GE</em> equal to <em>B</em>, and further <em>DH</em> equal to <em>C</em>; let <em>GH</em> be joined, and let <em>EF</em> be drawn through <em>E</em> parallel to it. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Since, then, <em>GH</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>EF</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>DEF</em>, therefore, as <em>DG</em> is to <em>GE</em>, so is <em>DH</em> to <em>HF</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>DG</em> is equal to <em>A</em>, <em>GE</em> to <em>B</em>, and <em>DH</em> to <em>C</em>; therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>HF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore to the three given straight lines <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> a fourth proportional <em>HF</em> has been found. Q. E. F.</p>
