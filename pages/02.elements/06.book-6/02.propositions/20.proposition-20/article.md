<p><em>Similar polygons are divded into similar triangles</em>, <em>and into triangles equal in multitude and in the same ratio as the wholes</em>, <em>and the polygon has to the polygon a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding</em>
       <lb n="5"/><em>side</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCDE</em>, <em>FGHKL</em> be similar polygons, and let <em>AB</em> correspond to <em>FG</em>; I say that the polygons <em>ABCDE</em>, <em>FGHKL</em> are divded into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in <lb n="10"/>the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon <em>ABCDE</em> has to the polygon <em>FGHKL</em> a ratio duplicate of that which <em>AB</em> has to <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>BE</em>, <em>EC</em>, <em>GL</em>, <em>LH</em> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since the polygon <em>ABCDE</em> is similar to the polygon <lb n="15"/><em>FGHKL</em>, the angle <em>BAE</em> is equal to the angle <em>GFL</em>; <span class="center">and, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AE</em>, so is <em>GF</em> to <em>FL</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Since then <em>ABE</em>, <em>FGL</em> are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles <lb n="20"/>proportional, therefore the triangle <em>ABE</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>FGL</em>; [<a href="/elem.6.6">VI. 6</a>] <span class="center">so that it is also similar; [<a href="/elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1">VI. 4 and Def. 1</a>]</span> therefore the angle <em>ABE</em> is equal to the angle <em>FGL</em>. <pb n="236"/><lb n="25"/></p>

<p>But the whole angle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the whole angle <em>FGH</em> because of the similarity of the polygons; therefore the remaining angle <em>EBC</em> is equal to the angle <em>LGH</em>. </p>

<p>And, since, because of the similarity of the triangles <em>ABE</em>, <lb n="30"/><em>FGL</em>, <span class="center">as <em>EB</em> is to <em>BA</em>, so is <em>LG</em> to <em>GF</em>,</span> and moreover also, because of the similarity of the polygons, <span class="center">as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>FG</em> to <em>GH</em>,</span> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <em>EB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>LG</em> to <em>GH</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] <lb n="35"/>that is, the sides about the equal angles <em>EBC</em>, <em>LGH</em> are proportional; therefore the triangle <em>EBC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>LGH</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.6">VI. 6</a>] <span class="center">so that the triangle <em>EBC</em> is also similar to the triangle <lb n="40"/><em>LGH</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1">VI. 4 and Def. 1</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason the triangle <em>ECD</em> is also similar to the triangle <em>LHK</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the similar polygons <em>ABCDE</em>, <em>FGHKL</em> have been divded into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in <lb n="45"/>multitude. </p>

<p>I say that they are also in the same ratio as the wholes, that is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional, and <em>ABE</em>, <em>EBC</em>, <em>ECD</em> are antecedents, while <em>FGL</em>, <em>LGH</em>, <em>LHK</em> are their consequents, and that the polygon <em>ABCDE</em>
       <lb n="50"/>has to the polygon <em>FGHKL</em> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is <em>AB</em> to <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>AC</em>, <em>FH</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then since, because of the similarity of the polygons, <lb n="55"/>the angle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the angle <em>FGH</em>, and, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>FG</em> to <em>GH</em>, <span class="center">the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>FGH</em>; [<a href="/elem.6.6">VI. 6</a>] therefore the angle <em>BAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>GFH</em>, and the angle <em>BCA</em> to the angle <em>GHF</em>.</span>
       <lb n="60"/></p>

<p>And, since the angle <em>BAM</em> is equal to the angle <em>GFN</em>, and the angle <em>ABM</em> is also equal to the angle <em>FGN</em>, <pb n="237"/>therefore the remaining angle <em>AMB</em> is also equal to the remaining angle <em>FNG</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <em>ABM</em> is equiangular with the triangle <lb n="65"/><em>FGN</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <em>BMC</em> is also equiangular with the triangle <em>GNH</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <em>AM</em> is to <em>MB</em>, so is <em>FN</em> to <em>NG</em>, <lb n="70"/>and, as <em>BM</em> is to <em>MC</em>, so is <em>GN</em> to <em>NH</em>; so that, in addition, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, <span class="center">as <em>AM</em> is to <em>MC</em>, so is <em>FN</em> to <em>NH</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But, as <em>AM</em> is to <em>MC</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABM</em> to <em>MBC</em>, and <em>AME</em> to <em>EMC</em>; for they are to one another as their <lb n="75"/>bases. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>] therefore, as the triangle <em>AMB</em> is to <em>BMC</em>, so is <em>ABE</em> to <em>CBE</em>. <lb n="80"/></p>

<p>But, as <em>AMB</em> is to <em>BMC</em>, so is <em>AM</em> to <em>MC</em>; therefore also, as <em>AM</em> is to <em>MC</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABE</em> to the triangle <em>EBC</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason also, as <em>FN</em> is to <em>NH</em>, so is the triangle <em>FGL</em> to the triangle <lb n="85"/><em>GLH</em>. </p>

<p>And, as <em>AM</em> is to <em>MC</em>, so is <em>FN</em> to <em>NH</em>; therefore also, as the triangle <em>ABE</em> is to the triangle <em>BEC</em>, so is the triangle <em>FGL</em> to the triangle <em>GLH</em>; and, alternately, as the triangle <em>ABE</em> is to the triangle <em>FGL</em>, <lb n="90"/>so is the triangle <em>BEC</em> to the triangle <em>GLH</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove, if <em>BD</em>, <em>GK</em> be joined, that, as the triangle <em>BEC</em> is to the triangle <em>LGH</em>, so also is the triangle <em>ECD</em> to the triangle <em>LHK</em>. </p>

<p>And since, as the triangle <em>ABE</em> is to the triangle <em>FGL</em>, <lb n="95"/>so is <em>EBC</em> to <em>LGH</em>, and further <em>ECD</em> to <em>LHK</em>, therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a> therefore, as the triangle <em>ABE</em> is to the triangle <em>FGL</em>, so is the polygon <em>ABCDE</em> to the polygon <em>FGHKL</em>. <pb n="238"/><lb n="100"/></p>

<p>But the triangle <em>ABE</em> has to the triangle <em>FGL</em> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <em>AB</em> has to the corresponding side <em>FG</em>; for similar triangles are in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides. [<a href="/elem.6.19">VI. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the polygon <em>ABCDE</em> also has to the polygon <lb n="105"/><em>FGHKL</em> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <em>AB</em> has to the corresponding side <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. </p>

<p>Similarly also it can be proved in the case of quadrilaterals that they are in the duplicate ratio of the <lb n="110"/>corresponding sides. And it was also proved in the case of triangles; therefore also, generally, similar rectilineal figures are to one another in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides. Q. E. D.</p>
