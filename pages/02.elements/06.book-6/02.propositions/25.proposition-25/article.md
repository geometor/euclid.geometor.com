<p><emph>To construct one and the same figure similar to a given rectilineal figure and equal to another given rectilineal figure</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To construct one and the same figure similar to a given rectilineal figure and equal to another given rectilineal figure</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be constructed must be similar, and <em>D</em> that to which it must be equal; thus it is required to construct one and the same figure similar to <em>ABC</em> and equal to <em>D</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let there be applied to <em>BC</em> the parallelogram <em>BE</em> equal to the triangle <em>ABC</em> [<a href="/elem.1.44">I. 44</a>], and to <em>CE</em> the parallelogram <em>CM</em> equal to <em>D</em> in the angle <em>FCE</em> which is equal to the angle <em>CBL</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.45">I. 45</a>] <pb n="254"/></p>

<p>Therefore <em>BC</em> is in a straight line with <em>CF</em>, and <em>LE</em> with <em>EM</em>. </p>

<p>Now let <em>GH</em> be taken a mean proportional to <em>BC</em>, <em>CF</em> [<a href="/elem.6.13">VI. 13</a>], and on <em>GH</em> let <em>KGH</em> be described similar and similarly situated to <em>ABC</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.18">VI. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>GH</em>, so is <em>GH</em> to <em>CF</em>, and, if three straight lines be proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly situated figure described on the second, [<a href="/elem.6.19.p.1">VI. 19, Por.</a>] therefore, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CF</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABC</em> to the triangle <em>KGH</em>. </p>

<p>But, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CF</em>, so also is the parallelogram <em>BE</em> to the parallelogram <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the triangle <em>ABC</em> is to the triangle <em>KGH</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>BE</em> to the parallelogram <em>EF</em>; therefore, alternately, as the triangle <em>ABC</em> is to the parallelogram <em>BE</em>, so is the triangle <em>KGH</em> to the parallelogram <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the parallelogram <em>BE</em>; therefore the triangle <em>KGH</em> is also equal to the parallelogram <em>EF</em>. </p>

<p>But the parallelogram <em>EF</em> is equal to <em>D</em>; therefore <em>KGH</em> is also equal to <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>And <em>KGH</em> is also similar to <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore one and the same figure <em>KGH</em> has been constructed similar to the given rectilineal figure <em>ABC</em> and equal to the other given figure <em>D</em>. Q. E. D.
