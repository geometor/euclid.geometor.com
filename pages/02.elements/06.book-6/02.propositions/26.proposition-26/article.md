===

<p><em>If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it</em>, <em>it is about the same diameter with the whole</em>
      </p>

<p>For from the parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> let there be taken away the parallelogram <em>AF</em> similar and similarly situated to <em>ABCD</em>, and having the angle <em>DAB</em> common with it;  I say that <em>ABCD</em> is about the same diameter with <em>AF</em>. </p>

<p>For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <em>AHC</em> be the diameter &lt; of <em>ABCD</em> &gt;, let <em>GF</em> be produced and carried through to <em>H</em>, and let <em>HK</em> be drawn through <em>H</em> parallel to either of the straight lines <em>AD</em>, <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Since, then, <em>ABCD</em> is about the same diameter with <em>KG</em>, therefore, as <em>DA</em> is to <em>AB</em>, so is <em>GA</em> to <em>AK</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.24">VI. 24</a>] </p>

<p>But also, because of the similarity of <em>ABCD</em>, <em>EG</em>, <span class="center">as <em>DA</em> is to <em>AB</em>, so is <em>GA</em> to <em>AE</em>;</span> therefore also, as <em>GA</em> is to <em>AK</em>, so is <em>GA</em> to <em>AE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <em>GA</em> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <em>AK</em>, <em>AE</em>. <pb n="256"/></p>

<p>Therefore <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>AK</em> [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>], the less to the greater : which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <em>ABCD</em> cannot but be about the same diameter with <em>AF</em>; therefore the parallelogram <em>ABCD</em> is about the same diameter with the parallelogram <em>AF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
