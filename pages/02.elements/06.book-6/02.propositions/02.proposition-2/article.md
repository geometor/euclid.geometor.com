<p><emph>If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle</emph>, <emph>it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and</emph>, <emph>if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally</emph>, <emph>the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle</em>, <em>it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and</em>, <em>if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally</em>, <em>the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>DE</em> be drawn parallel to <em>BC</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>ABC</em>; I say that, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>EA</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>BE</em>, <em>CD</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>BDE</em> is equal to  the triangle <em>CDE</em>; for they are on the same base <em>DE</em> and in the same parallels <em>DE</em>, <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.38">I. 38</a>] </p>

<p>And the triangle <em>ADE</em> is another area. </p>

<p>But equals have the same ratio to the same; [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] therefore, as the triangle <em>BDE</em> is to the triangle <em>ADE</em>, so is the triangle <em>CDE</em> to the triangle <em>ADE</em>. </p>

<p>But, as the triangle <em>BDE</em> is to <em>ADE</em>, so is <em>BD</em> to <em>DA</em>; for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from <em>E</em> to <em>AB</em>, they are to one another as their bases. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason also, as the triangle <em>CDE</em> is to <em>ADE</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>EA</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>EA</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] <pb n="195"/></p>

<p>Again, let the sides <em>AB</em>, <em>AC</em> of the triangle <em>ABC</em> be cut proportionally, so that, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>EA</em>; and let <em>DE</em> be joined. </p>

<p>I say that <em>DE</em> is parallel to <em>BC</em>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, since, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>CE</em> to <em>EA</em>, but, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is the triangle <em>BDE</em> to the triangle <em>ADE</em>, and, as <em>CE</em> is to <em>EA</em>, so is the triangle <em>CDE</em> to the triangle <em>ADE</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore also, <span class="center">as the triangle <em>BDE</em> is to the triangle <em>ADE</em>, so is the triangle <em>CDE</em> to the triangle <em>ADE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore each of the triangles <em>BDE</em>, <em>CDE</em> has the same ratio to <em>ADE</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>BDE</em> is equal to the triangle <em>CDE</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] and they are on the same base <em>DE</em>. </p>

<p>But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels. [<a href="/elem.1.39">I. 39</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <em>DE</em> is parallel to <em>BC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
