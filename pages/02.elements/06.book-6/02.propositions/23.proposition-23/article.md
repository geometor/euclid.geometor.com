<p><emph>Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AC</em>, <em>CF</em> be equiangular parallelograms having the angle <em>BCD</em> equal to the angle <em>ECG</em>; <lb n="5"/>I say that the parallelogram <em>AC</em> has to the parallelogram <em>CF</em> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. 
      </p>

<p>For let them be placed so that <em>BC</em> is in a straight line with <em>CG</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>DC</em> is also in a straight line with <em>CE</em>.</span>
       <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>Let the parallelogram <em>DG</em> be completed; let a straight line <em>K</em> be set out, and let it be contrived that, <span class="center">as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CG</em>, so is <em>K</em> to <em>L</em>,</span> and, as <em>DC</em> is to <em>CE</em>, so is <em>L</em> to <em>M</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>] <pb n="248"/></p>

<p>Then the ratios of <em>K</em> to <em>L</em> and of <em>L</em> to <em>M</em> are the same <lb n="15"/>as the ratios of the sides, namely of <em>BC</em> to <em>CG</em> and of <em>DC</em> to <em>CE</em>. </p>

<p>But the ratio of <em>K</em> to <em>M</em> is compounded of the ratio of <em>K</em> to <em>L</em> and of that of <em>L</em> to <em>M</em>; so that <em>K</em> has also to <em>M</em> the ratio compounded of the ratios <lb n="20"/>of the sides. </p>

<p>Now since, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CG</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>AC</em> to the parallelogram <em>CH</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] while, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CG</em>, so is <em>K</em> to <em>L</em>, therefore also, as <em>K</em> is to <em>L</em>, so is <em>AC</em> to <em>CH</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>Again, since, as <em>DC</em> is to <em>CE</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>CH</em> to <em>CF</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] while, as <em>DC</em> is to <em>CE</em>, so is <em>L</em> to <em>M</em>, therefore also, as <em>L</em> is to <em>M</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>CH</em> to the parallelogram <em>CF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>Since then it was proved that, as <em>K</em> is to <em>L</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>AC</em> to the parallelogram <em>CH</em>, and, as <em>L</em> is to <em>M</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>CH</em> to the parallelogram <em>CF</em>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <em>K</em> is to <em>M</em>, so is <em>AC</em> to the parallelogram<lb n="35"/>
       <em>CF</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>K</em> has to <em>M</em> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides; <span class="center">therefore <em>AC</em> also has to <em>CF</em> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.</span>
       <lb n="40"/></p>
