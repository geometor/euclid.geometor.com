<p><emph>On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line and <em>CE</em> the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to describe on the straight line <em>AB</em> a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to the rectilineal figure <em>CE</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <em>DF</em> be joined, and on the straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the points <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> on it, let the angle <em>GAB</em> be constructed equal to the angle at <em>C</em>, and the angle <em>ABG</em> equal to the angle <em>CDF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the remaining angle <em>CFD</em> is equal to the angle <em>AGB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] <span class="center">therefore the triangle <em>FCD</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>GAB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <em>FD</em> is to <em>GB</em>, so is <em>FC</em> to <em>GA</em>, and <em>CD</em> to <em>AB</em>. <pb n="230"/></p>

<p>Again, on the straight line <em>BG</em>, and at the points <em>B</em>, <em>G</em> on it, let the angle <em>BGH</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>DFE</em>, and the angle <em>GBH</em> equal to the angle <em>FDE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the remaining angle at <em>E</em> is equal to the remaining angle at <em>H</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] <span class="center">therefore the triangle <em>FDE</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>GBH</em>; therefore, proportionally, as <em>FD</em> is to <em>GB</em>, so is <em>FE</em> to <em>GH</em>, and <em>ED</em> to <em>HB</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was also proved that, as <em>FD</em> is to <em>GB</em>, so is <em>FC</em> to <em>GA</em>, and <em>CD</em> to <em>AB</em>; <span class="center">therefore also, as <em>FC</em> is to <em>AG</em>, so is <em>CD</em> to <em>AB</em>, and <em>FE</em> to <em>GH</em>, and further <em>ED</em> to <em>HB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since the angle <em>CFD</em> is equal to the angle <em>AGB</em>, and the angle <em>DFE</em> to the angle <em>BGH</em>, therefore the whole angle <em>CFE</em> is equal to the whole angle <em>AGH</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angle <em>CDE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>ABH</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And the angle at <em>C</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>A</em>, <span class="center">and the angle at <em>E</em> to the angle at <em>H</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>AH</em> is equiangular with <em>CE</em>; and they have the sides about their equal angles proportional; <span class="center">therefore the rectilineal figure <em>AH</em> is similar to the rectilineal figure <em>CE</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore on the given straight line <em>AB</em> the rectilineal figure <em>AH</em> has been described similar and similarly situated to the given rectilineal figure <em>CE</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
