<p><emph>If two triangles have their sides proportional</emph>, <emph>the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If two triangles have their sides proportional</em>, <em>the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> be two triangles having their sides proportional, so that, <span class="center">as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>DE</em> to <em>EF</em>, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CA</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>FD</em>,</span> and further, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so is <em>ED</em> to <em>DF</em>; I say that the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>, and they will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend, namely the angle <em>ABC</em> to the angle <em>DEF</em>, the angle <em>BCA</em> to the angle <em>EFD</em>, and further the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>EDF</em>. </p>

<p>For on the straight line <em>EF</em>, and at the points <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> on it, let there be constructed the angle <em>FEG</em> equal to the angle <em>ABC</em>, and the angle <em>EFG</em> equal to the angle <em>ACB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] <pb n="203"/><span class="center">therefore the remaining angle at <em>A</em> is equal to the remaining angle at <em>G</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>GEF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Therefore in the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>GEF</em> the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles; [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] <span class="center">therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>GE</em> to <em>EF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so by hypothesis is <em>DE</em> to <em>EF</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>DE</em> is to <em>EF</em>, so is <em>GE</em> to <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore each of the straight lines <em>DE</em>, <em>GE</em> has the same ratio to <em>EF</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>DE</em> is equal to <em>GE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>DF</em> is also equal to <em>GF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Since then <em>DE</em> is equal to <em>EG</em>, and <em>EF</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>DE</em>, <em>EF</em> are equal to the two sides <em>GE</em>, <em>EF</em>; and the base <em>DF</em> is equal to the base <em>FG</em>;</span> therefore the angle <em>DEF</em> is equal to the angle <em>GEF</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] and the triangle <em>DEF</em> is equal to the triangle <em>GEF</em>, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>DFE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>GFE</em>, <span class="center">and the angle <em>EDF</em> to the angle <em>EGF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since the angle <em>FED</em> is equal to the angle <em>GEF</em>, while the angle <em>GEF</em> is equal to the angle <em>ABC</em>, therefore the angle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>. <pb n="204"/></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angle <em>ACB</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DFE</em>,</span> and further, the angle at <em>A</em> to the angle at <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
