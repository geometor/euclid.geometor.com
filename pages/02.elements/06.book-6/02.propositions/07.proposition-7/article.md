<pb n="206"/><h1>PROPOSITION 7.</h1>
<p><em>If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle</em>, <em>the sides about other angles proportional</em>, <em>and the remaining angles either both less or both not less than a right angle</em>, <em>the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal</em>, <em>the sides about which are proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> be two triangles having one angle equal to one angle, the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>EDF</em>, the sides about other angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> proportional, so that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BC</em>, so is <em>DE</em> to <em>EF</em>, and, first, each of the remaining angles at <em>C</em>, <em>F</em> less than a right angle;  I say that the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>, the angle <em>ABC</em> will be equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>, and the remaining angle, namely the angle at <em>C</em>, equal to the remaining angle, the angle at <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For, if the angle <em>ABC</em> is unequal to the angle <em>DEF</em>, one of them is greater. </p>

<p>Let the angle <em>ABC</em> be greater; and on the straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the point <em>B</em> on it, let the angle <em>ABG</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since the angle <em>A</em> is equal to <em>D</em>, and the angle <em>ABG</em> to the angle <em>DEF</em>, therefore the remaining angle <em>AGB</em> is equal to the remaining angle <em>DFE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABG</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BG</em>, so is <em>DE</em> to <em>EF</em> [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <em>DE</em> is to <em>EF</em>, so by hypothesis is <em>AB</em> to <em>BC</em>; therefore <em>AB</em> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <em>BC</em>, <em>BG</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>BG</em>, [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>]</span> so that the angle at <em>C</em> is also equal to the angle <em>BGC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] <pb n="207"/></p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, the angle at <em>C</em> is less than a right angle; therefore the angle <em>BGC</em> is also less than a right angle; so that the angle <em>AGB</em> adjacent to it is greater than a right angle. [<a href="/elem.1.13">I. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And it was proved equal to the angle at <em>F</em>; therefore the angle at <em>F</em> is also greater than a right angle. </p>

<p>But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle : which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>ABC</em> is not unequal to the angle <em>DEF</em>; therefore it is equal to it. </p>

<p>But the angle at <em>A</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>D</em>; therefore the remaining angle at <em>C</em> is equal to the remaining angle at <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>. </p>

<p>But, again, let each of the angles at <em>C</em>, <em>F</em> be supposed not less than a right angle; I say again that, in this case too, the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <span class="center"><em>BC</em> is equal to <em>BG</em>;</span> so that the angle at <em>C</em> is also equal to the angle <em>BGC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle at <em>C</em> is not less than a right angle; therefore neither is the angle <em>BGC</em> less than a right angle. </p>

<p>Thus in the triangle <em>BGC</em> the two angles are not less than two right angles: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.1.17">I. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, once more, the angle <em>ABC</em> is not unequal to the angle <em>DEF</em>; therefore it is equal to it. </p>

<p>But the angle at <em>A</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>D</em>; therefore the remaining angle at <em>C</em> is equal to the remaining angle at <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] <pb n="208"/></p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
