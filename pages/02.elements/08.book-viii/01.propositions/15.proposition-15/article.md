<h1>PROPOSITION 15.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a cube number measure a cube number, the side will also measure the side; and, if the side measure the side, the cube will also measure the cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the cube number <span class="ital">A</span> measure the cube <span class="ital">B</span>, and let <span class="ital">C</span> be the side of <span class="ital">A</span> and <span class="ital">D</span> of <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. <pb n="369"/></p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">D</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">G</span>; further, let <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> make <span class="ital">F</span>, and let <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> make <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> respectively. 
      </p>

<p>Now it is manifest that <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> and <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.11 elem.8.12">VIII. 11, 12</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional, and <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore it also measures <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.7">VIII. 7</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> will also measure <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can prove in a similar manner that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, and, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">H</span>, [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] so that <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> also. Q. E. D.</p>
