<h1>PROPOSITION 8.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If between two numbers there fall numbers in continued proportion with them, then, however many numbers fall between them in continued proportion, so many will also fall in continued proportion between the numbers which have the same ratio with the original numbers.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> fall between the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> in continued proportion with them, and let <span class="ital">E</span> be made in the same ratio to <span class="ital">F</span> as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that, as many numbers as have fallen between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> in continued proportion, so many will also fall between <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> in continued proportion. 
      </p>

<p>For, as many as <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in multitude, let so many numbers <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a>] therefore the extremes of them <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.8.3">VIII. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, and the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">G</span> is to <span class="ital">L</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] <pb n="358"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span> the same number of times as <span class="ital">L</span> measures <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Next, as many times as <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>, so many times let <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> also measure <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span> respectively; therefore <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> measure <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> the same number of times. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are also in the same ratio with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are in continued proportion; therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are also in continued proportion. </p>

<p>Therefore, as many numbers as have fallen between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> in continued proportion with them, so many numbers have also fallen between <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> in continued proportion. Q. E. D.
