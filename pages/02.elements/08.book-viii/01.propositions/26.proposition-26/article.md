<h1>PROPOSITION 26.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be similar plane numbers; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.18">VIII. 18</a>] <pb n="382"/></p>

<p>Let it so fall, and let it be <span class="ital">C</span>; and let <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a> or <a href="/elem.8.2">VIII. 2</a>] therefore the extremes of them <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are square. [<a href="/elem.8.2.p.1">VIII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, and <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are square, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. Q. E. D.</p>
