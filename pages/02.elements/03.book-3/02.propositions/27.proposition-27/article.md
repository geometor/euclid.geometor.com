<p><emph>In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another</emph>, <emph>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another</em>, <em>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</em>. </p>

<p>For in equal circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em>, on equal circumferences <em>BC</em>, <em>EF</em>, let the angles <em>BGC</em>, <em>EHF</em> stand at the centres <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, and the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>EDF</em> at the circumferences; I say that the angle <em>BGC</em> is equal to the angle <em>EHF</em>, and the angle <em>BAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>EDF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if the angle <em>BGC</em> is unequal to the angle <em>EHF</em>, <span class="center">one of them is greater.</span> Let the angle <em>BGC</em> be greater : and on the straight line <em>BG</em>, and at the point <em>G</em> on it, let the angle <em>BGK</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>EHF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] </p>

<p>Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [<a href="/elem.3.26">III. 26</a>] <span class="center">therefore the circumference <em>BK</em> is equal to the circumference <em>EF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>EF</em> is equal to <em>BC</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>BK</em> is also equal to <em>BC</em>, the less to the greater : which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>BGC</em> is not unequal to the angle <em>EHF</em>; <span class="center">therefore it is equal to it.</span>
       <pb n="59"/></p>

<p>And the angle at <em>A</em> is half of the angle <em>BGC</em>, <span class="center">and the angle at <em>D</em> half of the angle <em>EHF</em>; [<a href="/elem.3.20">III. 20</a>]</span> therefore the angle at <em>A</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
