<p><emph>If two circles touch one another</emph>, <emph>they will not have the same centre</emph>. </p>

===

<pb n="13"/><h1>PROPOSITION 6.</h1>
<p><em>If two circles touch one another</em>, <em>they will not have the same centre</em>. </p>

<p>For let the two circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>CDE</em> touch one another at the point <em>C</em>; I say that they will not have the same centre. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be <em>F</em>; let <em>FC</em> be joined, and let <em>FEB</em> be drawn through at random. </p>

<p>Then, since the point <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>, <span class="center"><em>FC</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since the point <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle <em>CDE</em>, <span class="center"><em>FC</em> is equal to <em>FE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>FC</em> was proved equal to <em>FB</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>FE</em> is also equal to <em>FB</em>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>F</em> is not the centre of the circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>CDE</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
