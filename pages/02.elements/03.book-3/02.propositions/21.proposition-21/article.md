<p><emph>In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a circle, and let the angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>BED</em> be angles in the same segment <em>BAED</em>; I say that the angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>BED</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>For let the centre of the circle <em>ABCD</em> be taken, and let it be <em>F</em>; let 
       <em>BF</em>, <em>FD</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since the angle <em>BFD</em> is at the centre, <span class="center">and the angle <em>BAD</em> at the circumference, and they have the same circumference <em>BCD</em> as base, therefore the angle <em>BFD</em> is double of the angle <em>BAD</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.20">III. 20</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angle <em>BFD</em> is also double of the angle <em>BED</em>; therefore the angle <em>BAD</em> is equal to the angle <em>BED</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
