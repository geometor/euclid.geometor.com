<p><emph>In a circle the angle at the centre is double of the angle at the circumference</emph>, <emph>when the angles have the same circumference as base</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a circle the angle at the centre is double of the angle at the circumference</em>, <em>when the angles have the same circumference as base</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a circle, let the angle <em>BEC</em> be an angle <lb n="5"/>at its centre, and the angle <em>BAC</em> an angle at the circumference, and let them have the same circumference <em>BC</em> as base; I say that the angle <em>BEC</em> is double of <lb n="10"/>the angle <em>BAC</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>AE</em> be joined and drawn through to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>EA</em> is equal to <em>EB</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>EAB</em> is also equal to the <lb n="15"/>angle <em>EBA</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span> therefore the angles <em>EAB</em>, <em>EBA</em> are double of the angle <em>EAB</em>. </p>

<p>But the angle <em>BEF</em> is equal to the angles <em>EAB</em>, <em>EBA</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the angle <em>BEF</em> is also double of the angle <lb n="20"/><em>EAB</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angle <em>FEC</em> is also double of the angle <em>EAC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the whole angle <em>BEC</em> is double of the whole angle <em>BAC</em>. <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>Again let another straight line be inflected, and let there be another angle <em>BDC</em>; let <em>DE</em> be joined and produced to <em>G</em>. <pb n="47"/></p>

<p>Similarly then we can prove that the angle <em>GEC</em> is double of the angle <em>EDC</em>, <lb n="30"/><span class="center">of which the angle <em>GEB</em> is double of the angle <em>EDB</em>; therefore the angle <em>BEC</em> which remains is double of the angle <em>BDC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

<p><span class="bold">let another straight line be inflected</span>, <foreign lang="greek">κεκλάσθω δὴ πάλιν</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">εὐθεῖα</foreign>). The verb <foreign lang="greek">κλάω</foreign> (to <em>break off</em>) was the regular technical term for drawing from a point a (broken) straight line which first meets another straight line or curve and is then <em>bent back</em> from it to another point, or (in other words) for drawing straight lines from two points meeting at a point on a curve or another straight line. <foreign lang="greek">κεκλάσθαι</foreign> is one of the geometrical terms the definition of which must according to Aristotle be assumed (<xref n="Aristot. Post. Anal. 76b 9" from="ROOT" to="DITTO"><title>Anal. Post.</title> I. 10, 76 b 9</xref>).</p>
