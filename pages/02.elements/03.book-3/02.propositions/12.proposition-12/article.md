<h1>PROPOSITION 12.</h1>
<p><em>If two circles touch one another externally</em>, <em>the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact</em>. </p>

<p>For let the two circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADE</em> touch one another <lb n="5"/>externally at the point <em>A</em>, and let the centre <em>F</em> of <em>ABC</em>, and the centre <em>G</em> of <em>ADE</em>, be taken; <pb n="28"/>I say that the straight line joined from <em>F</em> to <em>G</em> will pass through the point of contact at <em>A</em>. </p>

<p>For suppose it does not, <lb n="10"/>but, if possible, let it pass as <em>FCDG</em>, and let <em>AF</em>, <em>AG</em> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since the point <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>, <lb n="15"/><span class="center"><em>FA</em> is equal to <em>FC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since the point <em>G</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ADE</em>, <span class="center"><em>GA</em> is equal to <em>GD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>FA</em> was also proved equal to <em>FC</em>; <lb n="20"/><span class="center">therefore <em>FA</em>, <em>AG</em> are equal to <em>FC</em>, <em>GD</em>, so that the whole <em>FG</em> is greater than <em>FA</em>, <em>AG</em>;</span> but it is also less [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>]: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line joined from <em>F</em> to <em>G</em> will not fail to pass through the point of contact at <em>A</em>; <lb n="25"/><span class="center">therefore it will pass through it.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
