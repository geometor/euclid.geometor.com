<p><emph>A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one</emph>, <emph>whether it touch it internally or externally</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one</em>, <em>whether it touch it internally or externally</em>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let the circle <em>ABDC</em> touch the circle <em>EBFD</em>, first internally, at more <lb n="5"/>points than one, namely <em>D</em>, <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>Let the centre <em>G</em> of the circle <em>ABDC</em>, and the centre <em>H</em> of <em>EBFD</em>, be taken. </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line 
       <lb n="10"/>joined from <em>G</em> to <em>H</em> will fall on <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.11">III. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Let it so fall, as <em>BGHD</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since the point <em>G</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABCD</em>, <lb n="15"/><span class="center"><em>BG</em> is equal to <em>GD</em>;</span>
       <pb n="33"/><span class="center">therefore <em>BG</em> is greater than <em>HD</em>; therefore <em>BH</em> is much greater than <em>HD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since the point <em>H</em> is the centre of the circle <em>EBFD</em>, <lb n="20"/><span class="center"><em>BH</em> is equal to <em>HD</em>;</span>
       <span class="center">but it was also proved much greater than it: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at more points than one. <lb n="25"/></p>

<p>I say further that neither does it so touch it externally. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let the circle <em>ACK</em> touch the circle <em>ABDC</em> at more points than one, namely <em>A</em>, <em>C</em>, and let <em>AC</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles <lb n="30"/><em>ABDC</em>, <em>ACK</em> two points <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within each circle; [<a href="/elem.3.2">III. 2</a>] <span class="center">but it fell within the circle <em>ABCD</em> and outside <em>ACK</em> [<a href="/elem.3.def.3">III. Def. 3</a>]: which is absurd.</span>
       <lb n="35"/></p>

<p>Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at more points than one. </p>

<p>And it was proved that neither does it so touch it internally. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
