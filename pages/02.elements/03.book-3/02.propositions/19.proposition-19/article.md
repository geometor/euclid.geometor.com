<p><emph>If a straight line touch a circle</emph>, <emph>and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent</emph>, <emph>the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a straight line touch a circle</em>, <em>and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent</em>, <em>the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn</em>. </p>

<p>For let a straight line <em>DE</em> touch the circle <em>ABC</em> at the point <em>C</em>, and from <em>C</em> let <em>CA</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>DE</em>; I say that the centre of the circle is on <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>For suppose it is not, but, if  possible, let <em>F</em> be the centre, and let <em>CF</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Since a straight line <em>DE</em> touches the circle <em>ABC</em>, and <em>FC</em> has been joined from the centre to the point of contact, <span class="center"><em>FC</em> is perpendicular to <em>DE</em>; [<a href="/elem.3.18">III. 18</a>] therefore the angle <em>FCE</em> is right.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>ACE</em> is also right; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>FCE</em> is equal to the angle <em>ACE</em>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>F</em> is not the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
