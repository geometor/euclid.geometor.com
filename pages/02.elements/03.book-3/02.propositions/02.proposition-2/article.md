<p><emph>If on the circumference of a circle two points be taken at random</emph>, <emph>the straight line joining the points will fall within the circle</emph>. </p>

===


<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a circle, and let two points <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> be taken at random on its circumference; I say that the straight line joined from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> will fall within the circle.
      </p>

<p>For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall outside, as <em>AEB</em>; let the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em> be taken [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>], and let it be <em>D</em>; let <em>DA</em>, <em>DB</em> be joined, and let <em>DFE</em> be drawn through. <pb n="9"/></p>

<p>Then, since <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>DAE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DBE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span> And, since one side <em>AEB</em> of the triangle <em>DAE</em> is produced, <span class="center">the angle <em>DEB</em> is greater than the angle <em>DAE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.16">I. 16</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>DAE</em> is equal to the angle <em>DBE</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>DEB</em> is greater than the angle <em>DBE</em>.</span> And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [<a href="/elem.1.19">I. 19</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>DB</em> is greater than <em>DE</em>. But <em>DB</em> is equal to <em>DF</em>;</span>
       <span class="center">therefore <em>DF</em> is greater than <em>DE</em>,</span>
       <span class="center">the less than the greater : which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line joined from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> will not fall outside the circle. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference itself; <span class="center">therefore it will fall within.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
