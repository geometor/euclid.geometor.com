<p><emph>Similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>AEB</em>, <em>CFD</em> be similar segments of circles on equal straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>; <lb n="5"/>I say that the segment <em>AEB</em> is equal to the segment <em>CFD</em>. </p>

<p>For, if the segment <em>AEB</em> be applied to <em>CFD</em>, and if the point <em>A</em> be placed on <em>C</em> and the straight line <em>AB</em> on <em>CD</em>, <pb n="54"/><span class="center">the point <em>B</em> will also coincide with the point <em>D</em>, because <em>AB</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>;</span>
       <lb n="10"/><span class="center">and, <em>AB</em> coinciding with <em>CD</em>, the segment <em>AEB</em> will also coincide with <em>CFD</em>.</span>
       
      </p>

<p>For, if the straight line <em>AB</em> coincide with <em>CD</em> but the segment <em>AEB</em> do not coincide with <em>CFD</em>, it will either fall with it, or outside it; <lb n="15"/>or it will fall awry, as <em>CGD</em>, and a circle cuts a circle at more points than two : which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.3.10">III. 10</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, if the straight line <em>AB</em> be applied to <em>CD</em>, the segment <em>AEB</em> will not fail to coincide with <em>CFD</em> also; <span class="center">therefore it will coincide with it and will be equal to it.</span>
       <lb n="20"/></p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="15" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
        
<p><span class="bold">fall awry</span>, <foreign lang="greek">παραλλάξει</foreign>, the same word as used in the like case in <a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>. The word implies that the applied figure will partly fall short of, and partly overlap, the figure to which it is applied.</p>
