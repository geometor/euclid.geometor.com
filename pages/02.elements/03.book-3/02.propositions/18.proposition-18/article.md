<p><emph>If a straight line touch a circle</emph>, <emph>and a straight line be joined from the centre to the point of contact</emph>, <emph>the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a straight line touch a circle</em>, <em>and a straight line be joined from the centre to the point of contact</em>, <em>the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent</em>. </p>

<p>For let a straight line <em>DE</em> touch the circle <em>ABC</em> at the point <em>C</em>, let the centre <em>F</em> of the circle <em>ABC</em> be taken, and let <em>FC</em> be joined from <em>F</em> to <em>C</em>; I say that <em>FC</em> is perpendicular to <em>DE</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if not, let <em>FG</em> be drawn from <em>F</em> perpendicular to <em>DE</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since the angle <em>FGC</em> is right, <span class="center">the angle <em>FCG</em> is acute; [<a href="/elem.1.17">I. 17</a>]</span> and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [<a href="/elem.1.19">I. 19</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>FC</em> is greater than <em>FG</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>FC</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>FB</em> is also greater than <em>FG</em>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>FG</em> is not perpendicular to <em>DE</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except <em>FC</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>FC</em> is perpendicular to <em>DE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.<blockquote place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
