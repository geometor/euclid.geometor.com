<p><emph>In a circle equal straight lines are equally distant from the centre</emph>, <emph>and those which are equally distant from the centre are equal to one another</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a circle equal straight lines are equally distant from the centre</em>, <em>and those which are equally distant from the centre are equal to one another</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABDC</em> be a circle, and let <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> be equal straight lines in it; I say that <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> are equally distant from the centre. </p>

<p>For let the centre of the circle <em>ABDC</em> be taken [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>], <pb n="35"/>and let it be <em>E</em>; from <em>E</em> let <em>EF</em>, <em>EG</em> be drawn perpendicular to <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>, and let <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since a straight line <em>EF</em> through the centre cuts a straight line <em>AB</em> not through the centre at right angles, it also bisects it. [<a href="/elem.3.3">III. 3</a>] 
       <span class="center">Therefore <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>; therefore <em>AB</em> is double of <em>AF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>CD</em> is also double of <em>CG</em>;</span> and <em>AB</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AF</em> is also equal to <em>CG</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>EC</em>, <span class="center">the square on <em>AE</em> is also equal to the square on <em>EC</em>.</span> But the squares on <em>AF</em>, <em>EF</em> are equal to the square on <em>AE</em>, for the angle at <em>F</em> is right; and the squares on <em>EG</em>, <em>GC</em> are equal to the square on <em>EC</em>, for the angle at <em>G</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <span class="center">therefore the squares on <em>AF</em>, <em>FE</em> are equal to the squares on <em>CG</em>, <em>GE</em>,</span> of which the square on <em>AF</em> is equal to the square on <em>CG</em>, for <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>CG</em>; <span class="center">therefore the square on <em>FE</em> which remains is equal to the square on <em>EG</em>, therefore <em>EF</em> is equal to <em>EG</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But in a circle straight lines are said to be equally distant from the centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the centre are equal; [<a href="/elem.3.def.4">III. Def. 4</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> are equally distant from the centre.</span>
      </p>

<p>Next, let the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> be equally distant from the centre; that is, let <em>EF</em> be equal to <em>EG</em>. </p>

<p>I say that <em>AB</em> is also equal to <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can prove, similarly, that <em>AB</em> is double of <em>AF</em>, and <em>CD</em> of <em>CG</em>. </p>

<p>And, since <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>CE</em>, <span class="center">the square on <em>AE</em> is equal to the square on <em>CE</em>.</span> But the squares on <em>EF</em>, <em>FA</em> are equal to the square on <em>AE</em>, and the squares on <em>EG</em>, <em>GC</em> equal to the square on <em>CE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <pb n="36"/></p>

<p>Therefore the squares on <em>EF</em>, <em>FA</em> are equal to the squares on <em>EG</em>, <em>GC</em>, of which the square on <em>EF</em> is equal to the square on <em>EG</em>, for <em>EF</em> is equal to <em>EG</em>; therefore the square on <em>AF</em> which remains is equal to the square on <em>CG</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>CG</em>.</span> And <em>AB</em> is double of <em>AF</em>, and <em>CD</em> double of <em>CG</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AB</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
