<p><emph>Given a segment of a circle</emph>, <emph>to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Given a segment of a circle</em>, <em>to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given segment of a circle; thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment <em>ABC</em>, that is, of which it is a segment. </p>

<p>For let <em>AC</em> be bisected at <em>D</em>, let <em>DB</em> be drawn from the point <em>D</em> at right angles to <em>AC</em>, and let <em>AB</em>. be joined; <pb n="55"/><span class="center">the angle <em>ABD</em> is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle <em>BAD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>First let it be greater; and on the straight line <em>BA</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, let the angle <em>BAE</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>ABD</em>; let <em>DB</em> be drawn through to <em>E</em>, and let <em>EC</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since the angle <em>ABE</em> is equal to the angle <em>BAE</em>, 
       <span class="center">the straight line <em>EB</em> is also equal to <em>EA</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>DC</em>, and <em>DE</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>AD</em>, <em>DE</em> are equal to the two sides <em>CD</em>, <em>DE</em> respectively;</span> and the angle <em>ADE</em> is equal to the angle <em>CDE</em>, for each is right; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>AE</em> is equal to the base <em>CE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>AE</em> was proved equal to <em>BE</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>BE</em> is also equal to <em>CE</em>;</span> therefore the three straight lines <em>AE</em>, <em>EB</em>, <em>EC</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore the circle drawn with centre <em>E</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>AE</em>, <em>EB</em>, <em>EC</em> will also pass through the remaining points and will have been completed. [<a href="/elem.3.9">III. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. </p>

<p>And it is manifest that the segment <em>ABC</em> is less than a semicircle, because the centre <em>E</em> happens to be outside it. </p>

<p>Similarly, even if the angle <em>ABD</em> be equal to the angle <em>BAD</em>, <em>AD</em> being equal to each of the two <em>BD</em>, <em>DC</em>, <span class="center">the three straight lines <em>DA</em>, <em>DB</em>, <em>DC</em> will be equal to one another, 
        <em>D</em> will be the centre of the completed circle, and <em>ABC</em> will clearly be a semicircle.</span>
       <pb n="56"/></p>

<p>But, if the angle <em>ABD</em> be less than the angle <em>BAD</em>, and if we construct, on the straight line <em>BA</em> and at the point <em>A</em> on it, an angle equal to the angle <em>ABD</em>, the centre will fall on <em>DB</em> within the segment <em>ABC</em>, and the segment 
       <em>ABC</em> will clearly be greater than a semicircle. </p>

<p>Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. Q. E. F.
