<p><em>If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point straight lines be drawn through to the circle</em>, <em>one of which is through the centre and the others are drawn at random</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>of the straight lines which fall on the concave circumference</em>, <em>that through the centre is greatest</em>, <em>while of the rest</em>
       <pb n="18"/><em>the nearer to that through the centre is always greater than the more remote</em>, <em>but</em>, <em>of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference</em>, <em>that between the point and the diameter is least</em>, <em>while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote</em>, <em>and only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle from the point</em>, <em>one on each side of the least</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a circle, and let a point <em>D</em> be taken outside <em>ABC</em>; let there be drawn through from it straight lines <em>DA</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>DF</em>, <em>DC</em>, and let <em>DA</em> be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference <em>AEFC</em>, the straight line <em>DA</em> through the centre is greatest,  while <em>DE</em> is greater than <em>DF</em> and <em>DF</em> than <em>DC</em>.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference <em>HLKG</em>, the straight line <em>DG</em> between the point and the diameter <em>AG</em> is least; and the nearer to the least <em>DG</em> is always less than the more remote, namely <em>DK</em> than <em>DL</em>, and <em>DL</em> than <em>DH</em>. </p>

<p>For let the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em> be taken [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>], and let it be <em>M</em>; let <em>ME</em>, <em>MF</em>, <em>MC</em>, <em>MK</em>, <em>ML</em>, <em>MH</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AM</em> is equal to <em>EM</em>, let <em>MD</em> be added to each; <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>EM</em>, <em>MD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>EM</em>, <em>MD</em> are greater than <em>ED</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> is also greater than <em>ED</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>ME</em> is equal to <em>MF</em>, <span class="center">and <em>MD</em> is common,</span> therefore <em>EM</em>, <em>MD</em> are equal to <em>FM</em>, <em>MD</em>; <span class="center">and the angle <em>EMD</em> is greater than the angle <em>FMD</em>;</span>
       <span class="center">therefore the base <em>ED</em> is greater than the base <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.24">I. 24</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <em>FD</em> is greater than <em>CD</em>; therefore <em>DA</em> is greatest, while <em>DE</em> is greater than <em>DF</em>, and <em>DF</em> than <em>DC</em>. <pb n="19"/></p>

<p>Next, since <em>MK</em>, <em>KD</em> are greater than <em>MD</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>] and <em>MG</em> is equal to <em>MK</em>, therefore the remainder <em>KD</em> is greater than the remainder <em>GD</em>, <span class="center">so that <em>GD</em> is less than <em>KD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since on <em>MD</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>MLD</em>, two straight lines <em>MK</em>, <em>KD</em> were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore <em>MK</em>, <em>KD</em> are less than <em>ML</em>, <em>LD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.21">I. 21</a>] and <em>MK</em> is equal to <em>ML</em>; <span class="center">therefore the remainder <em>DK</em> is less than the remainder <em>DL</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <em>DL</em> is also less than <em>DH</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>DG</em> is least, while <em>DK</em> is less than <em>DL</em>, and <em>DL</em> than <em>DH</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point <em>D</em> on the circle, one on each side of the least <em>DG</em>. </p>

<p>On the straight line <em>MD</em>, and at the point <em>M</em> on it, let the angle <em>DMB</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>KMD</em>, and let <em>DB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>MK</em> is equal to <em>MB</em>, and <em>MD</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>KM</em>, <em>MD</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BM</em>, <em>MD</em> respectively;</span> and the angle <em>KMD</em> is equal to the angle <em>BMD</em>; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>DK</em> is equal to the base <em>DB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line <em>DK</em> will fall on the circle from the point <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be <em>DN</em>. <span class="center">Then, since <em>DK</em> is equal to <em>DN</em>,</span>
      </p>

<p>while <em>DK</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>, <span class="center"><em>DB</em> is also equal to <em>DN</em>,</span> that is, the nearer to the least <em>DG</em> equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle <em>ABC</em> from the point <em>D</em>, one on each side of <em>DG</em> the least. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
