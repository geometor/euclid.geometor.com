<p><em>In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right</em>, <em>that in a greater segment less than a right angle</em>, <em>and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle</em>, <em>and the angle of the less segment less than a right angle</em>. <pb n="62"/></p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a circle, let <em>BC</em> be its diameter, and <em>E</em> its centre, and let <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>, <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> be joined; I say that the angle <em>BAC</em> in the semicircle <em>BAC</em> is right, the angle <em>ABC</em> in the segment <em>ABC</em> greater than the semicircle is less  than a right angle, and the angle <em>ADC</em> in the segment <em>ADC</em> less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle. </p>

<p>Let <em>AE</em> be joined, and let <em>BA</em> be carried through to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>EA</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>ABE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>BAE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>CE</em> is equal to <em>EA</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>ACE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>CAE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the whole angle <em>BAC</em> is equal to the two angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ACB</em>. </p>

<p>But the angle <em>FAC</em> exterior to the triangle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the two angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ACB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>FAC</em>; therefore each is right; [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">I. Def. 10</a>] therefore the angle <em>BAC</em> in the semicircle <em>BAC</em> is right.</span>
      </p>

<p>Next, since in the triangle <em>ABC</em> the two angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BAC</em> are less than two right angles, [<a href="/elem.1.17">I. 17</a>] and the angle <em>BAC</em> is a right angle, <span class="center">the angle <em>ABC</em> is less than a right angle;</span> and it is the angle in the segment <em>ABC</em> greater than the semicircle. </p>

<p>Next, since <em>ABCD</em> is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [<a href="/elem.3.22">III. 22</a>] while the angle <em>ABC</em> is less than a right angle, therefore the angle <em>ADC</em> which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment <em>ADC</em> less than the semicircle. <pb n="63"/></p>

<p>I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference <em>ABC</em> and the straight line <em>AC</em>, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference <em>ADC</em> and the straight line <em>AC</em>, is less than a right angle. </p>

<p>This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em> is right, <span class="center">the angle contained by the circumference <em>ABC</em> and the straight line <em>AC</em> is greater than a right angle.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines <em>AC</em>, <em>AF</em> is right, <span class="center">the angle contained by the straight line <em>CA</em> and the circumference <em>ADC</em> is less than a right angle.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
