<p><emph>If in a circle two straight lines cut one another</emph>, <emph>the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If in a circle two straight lines cut one another</em>, <em>the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other</em>. </p>

<p>For in the circle <em>ABCD</em> let the two straight lines <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> cut one another at the point <em>E</em>; I say that the rectangle contained by <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> is equal to the rectangle contained by <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em>. 
      </p>

<p>If now <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> are through the centre, so that <em>E</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABCD</em>, it is manifest that, <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em> being equal, the rectangle contained by <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> is also equal to the rectangle contained by <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em>. <pb n="72"/></p>

<p>Next let <em>AC</em>, <em>DB</em> not be through the centre; let the centre of <em>ABCD</em> be taken, and let it be <em>F</em>; from <em>F</em> let <em>FG</em>, <em>FH</em> be drawn perpendicular to the straight lines <em>AC</em>, <em>DB</em>, and let <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em>, <em>FE</em> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since a straight line <em>GF</em> through the centre cuts a straight line <em>AC</em> not through the centre at right angles, <span class="center">it also bisects it; [<a href="/elem.3.3">III. 3</a>] therefore <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>GC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Since, then, the straight line <em>AC</em> has been cut into equal parts at <em>G</em> and into unequal parts at <em>E</em>, the rectangle contained by <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> together with the square on <em>EG</em> is equal to the square on <em>GC</em>; [<a href="/elem.2.5">II. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Let the square on <em>GF</em> be added; therefore the rectangle <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> together with the squares on <em>GE</em>, <em>GF</em> is equal to the squares on <em>CG</em>, <em>GF</em>. </p>

<p>But the square on <em>FE</em> is equal to the squares on <em>EG</em>, <em>GF</em>, and the square on <em>FC</em> is equal to the squares on <em>CG</em>, <em>GF</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <span class="center">therefore the rectangle <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> together with the square on <em>FE</em> is equal to the square on <em>FC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And <em>FC</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>; therefore the rectangle <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> together with the square on <em>EF</em> is equal to the square on <em>FB</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason, also, the rectangle <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em> together with the square on <em>FE</em> is equal to the square on <em>FB</em>. </p>

<p>But the rectangle <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> together with the square on <em>FE</em> was also proved equal to the square on <em>FB</em>; therefore the rectangle <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> together with the square on <em>FE</em> is equal to the rectangle <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em> together with the square on <em>FE</em>. </p>

<p>Let the square on <em>FE</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle contained by <em>AE</em>, <em>EC</em> which remains is equal to the rectangle contained by <em>DE</em>, <em>EB</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
