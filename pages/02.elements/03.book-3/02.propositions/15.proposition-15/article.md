<p><emph>Of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest</emph>, <emph>and of the rest the nearer to the centre is always greater than the more remote</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest</em>, <em>and of the rest the nearer to the centre is always greater than the more remote</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a circle, let <em>AD</em> be its diameter and <em>E</em> the centre; and let <em>BC</em> be nearer to the diameter <em>AD</em>, and <em>FG</em> more remote; I say that <em>AD</em> is greatest and <em>BC</em> greater than <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>For from the centre <em>E</em> let <em>EH</em>, <em>EK</em>
        be drawn perpendicular to <em>BC</em>, <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>BC</em> is nearer to the centre and <em>FG</em> more remote, <em>EK</em> is greater than <em>EH</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.def.5">III. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Let <em>EL</em> be made equal to <em>EH</em>, through <em>L</em> let <em>LM</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>EK</em> and carried through to <em>N</em>, and let <em>ME</em>, <em>EN</em>, <em>FE</em>, <em>EG</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>EH</em> is equal to <em>EL</em>, <span class="center"><em>BC</em> is also equal to <em>MN</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.14">III. 14</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>EM</em>, and <em>ED</em> to <em>EN</em>, <span class="center"><em>AD</em> is equal to <em>ME</em>, <em>EN</em>.</span>
       <pb n="37"/></p>

<p>But <em>ME</em>, <em>EN</em> are greater than <em>MN</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>] and <em>MN</em> is equal to <em>BC</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> is greater than <em>BC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <em>ME</em>, <em>EN</em> are equal to the two sides <em>FE</em>, <em>EG</em>, and the angle <em>MEN</em> greater than the angle <em>FEG</em>, therefore the base <em>MN</em> is greater than the base <em>FG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.24">I. 24</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>MN</em> was proved equal to <em>BC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the diameter <em>AD</em> is greatest and <em>BC</em> greater than <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
