<p><emph>If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre</emph>, <emph>they do not bisect one another</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre</em>, <em>they do not bisect one another</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em>, which are not through the centre, cut one another at <em>E</em>;  I say that they do not bisect one another. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>EC</em>, and <em>BE</em> to <em>ED</em>; let the centre of the circle <em>ABCD</em> be taken [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>], and let it be <em>F</em>; let <em>FE</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since a straight line <em>FE</em> through the centre bisects a straight line <em>AC</em> not through the centre, <span class="center">it also cuts it at right angles; [<a href="/elem.3.3">III. 3</a>] therefore the angle <em>FEA</em> is right.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since a straight line <em>FE</em> bisects a straight line <em>BD</em>, <span class="center">it also cuts it at right angles; [<a href="/elem.3.3">III. 3</a>] therefore the angle <em>FEB</em> is right.</span>
       <pb n="12"/></p>

<p>But the angle <em>FEA</em> was also proved right; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>FEA</em> is equal to the angle <em>FEB</em>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> do not bisect one another. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
