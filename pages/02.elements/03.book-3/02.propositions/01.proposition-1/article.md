<p><emph>To find the centre of a given circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To find the centre of a given circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>. </p>

<p>Let a straight line <em>AB</em> be drawn <lb n="5"/>through it at random, and let it be bisected at the point <em>D</em>; from <em>D</em> let <em>DC</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>AB</em> and let it be drawn through to <em>E</em>; let <em>CE</em> be bisected at <em>F</em>; <lb n="10"/>I say that <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <em>G</em> be the centre, and let <em>GA</em>, <em>GD</em>, <em>GB</em> be joined. <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>Then, since <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>DB</em>, and <em>DG</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>AD</em>, <em>DG</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BD</em>, <em>DG</em> respectively;</span> and the base <em>GA</em> is equal to the base <em>GB</em>, for they are <lb n="20"/>radii; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>ADG</em> is equal to the angle <em>GDB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">I. Def. 10</a>] <lb n="25"/><span class="center">therefore the angle <em>GDB</em> is right.</span>
       <pb n="7"/></p>

<p>But the angle <em>FDB</em> is also right; therefore the angle <em>FDB</em> is equal to the angle <em>GDB</em>, the greater to the less: which is impossible. <span class="center">Therefore <em>G</em> is not the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>.</span>
       <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except <em>F</em>. <span class="center">Therefore the point <em>F</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>.</span>

<p>From this it is manifest that, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at <lb n="35"/>right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line. Q. E. F.</p>

<p><span class="bold">the two sides AD, DG are equal to the two sides BD, DG respectively.</span> As before observed, Euclid is not always careful to put the equals in corresponding order. The text here has <quote><em>GD</em>, <em>DB</em>.</quote>
