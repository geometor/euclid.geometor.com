<h1>PROPOSITION 36.</h1>
<p><em>If a point be taken outside a circle and from it there fall on the circle two straight lines</em>, <em>and if one of them cut the circle and the other touch it</em>, <em>the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts the circle and the straight <pb n="74"/>line intercepted on it outside between the point and the convex circumference will be equal to the square on the tangent</em>. </p>

<p>For let a point <em>D</em> be taken outside the circle <em>ABC</em>, and from <em>D</em> let the two straight lines <em>DCA</em>, <em>DB</em> fall on the circle <em>ABC</em>; let <em>DCA</em> cut the circle <em>ABC</em> and let <em>BD</em> touch it; I say that the rectangle contained by <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> is equal to the square on <em>DB</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Then <em>DCA</em> is either through the centre or not through the centre. </p>

<p>First let it be through the centre, and let <em>F</em> be the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>; let <em>FB</em> be joined; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>FBD</em> is right. [<a href="/elem.3.18">III. 18</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>AC</em> has been bisected at <em>F</em>, and <em>CD</em> is added to it, the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>FC</em> is equal to the square on <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>FC</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>; therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>FB</em> is equal to the square on <em>FD</em>. </p>

<p>And the squares on <em>FB</em>, <em>BD</em> are equal to the square on <em>FD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>FB</em> is equal to the squares on <em>FB</em>, <em>BD</em>. </p>

<p>Let the square on <em>FB</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> which remains is equal to the square on the tangent <em>DB</em>. </p>

<p>Again, let <em>DCA</em> not be through the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>; let the centre <em>E</em> be taken, and from <em>E</em> let <em>EF</em> be drawn perpendicular to <em>AC</em>; let <em>EB</em>, <em>EC</em>, <em>ED</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then the angle <em>EBD</em> is right. [<a href="/elem.3.18">III. 18</a>] 
      </p>

<p>And, since a straight line <em>EF</em> through the centre cuts a straight line <em>AC</em> not through the centre at right angles, <span class="center">it also bisects it; [<a href="/elem.3.3">III. 3</a>] therefore <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FC</em>.</span>
       <pb n="75"/></p>

<p>Now, since the straight line <em>AC</em> has been bisected at the point <em>F</em>, and <em>CD</em> is added to it, the rectangle contained by <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>FC</em> is equal to the square on <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Let the square on <em>FE</em> be added to each; therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the squares on <em>CF</em>, <em>FE</em> is equal to the squares on <em>FD</em>, <em>FE</em>. </p>

<p>But the square on <em>EC</em> is equal to the squares on <em>CF</em>, <em>FE</em>, for the angle <em>EFC</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] and the square on <em>ED</em> is equal to the squares on <em>DF</em>, <em>FE</em>; therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>EC</em> is equal to the square on <em>ED</em>. </p>

<p>And <em>EC</em> is equal to <em>EB</em>; therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>EB</em> is equal to the square on <em>ED</em>. </p>

<p>But the squares on <em>EB</em>, <em>BD</em> are equal to the square on <em>ED</em>, for the angle <em>EBD</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> together with the square on <em>EB</em> is equal to the squares on <em>EB</em>, <em>BD</em>. </p>

<p>Let the square on <em>EB</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> which remains is equal to the square on <em>DB</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
