<p><emph>The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle</emph>, <emph>and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater</emph>, <emph>and the remaining angle less</emph>, <emph>than any acute rectilineal angle</emph>. </p>

<p><em>The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle</em>, <em>and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater</em>, <em>and the remaining angle less</em>, <em>than any acute rectilineal angle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a circle about <em>D</em> as centre and <em>AB</em> as diameter; <pb n="38"/>I say that the straight line drawn from <em>A</em> at right angles to <em>AB</em> from its extremity will fall outside the circle. </p>

<p>For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as <em>CA</em>, and let <em>DC</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Since <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>DC</em>, 
       <span class="center">the angle <em>DAC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>ACD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>DAC</em> is right; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>ACD</em> is also right:</span> thus, in the triangle <em>ACD</em>, the two angles <em>DAC</em>, <em>ACD</em> are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.1.17">I. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line drawn from the point <em>A</em> at right angles to <em>BA</em> will not fall within the circle. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference; <span class="center">therefore it will fall outside.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let it fall as <em>AE</em>; I say next that into the space between the straight line <em>AE</em> and the circumference <em>CHA</em> another straight line cannot be interposed. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as <em>FA</em>, and let <em>DG</em> be drawn from the point <em>D</em> perpendicular to <em>FA</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since the angle <em>AGD</em> is right, <span class="center">and the angle <em>DAG</em> is less than a right angle, <em>AD</em> is greater than <em>DG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.19">I. 19</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>DA</em> is equal to <em>DH</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>DH</em> is greater than <em>DG</em>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference. </p>

<p>I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line <em>BA</em> and the circumference <em>CHA</em> is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference <em>CHA</em> and the straight line <em>AE</em> is less than any acute rectilineal angle. </p>

<p>For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line <em>BA</em> and the circumference <pb n="39"/><em>CHA</em>, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference <em>CHA</em> and the straight line <em>AE</em>, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line <em>AE</em> a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line <em>BA</em> and the circumference <em>CHA</em>, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference <em>CHA</em> and the straight line <em>AE</em>. </p>

<p>But such a straight line cannot be interposed; </p>

<p>therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line <em>BA</em> and the circumference <em>CHA</em>, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference <em>CHA</em> and the straight line <em>AE</em>.— </p>

<p>From this it is manifest that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity touches the circle. Q. E. D.</p>
