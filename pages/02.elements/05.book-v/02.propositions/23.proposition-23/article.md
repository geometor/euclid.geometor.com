<h1>PROPOSITION 23.</h1>
<p><em>If there be three magnitudes</em>, <em>and others equal to them in multitude</em>, <em>which taken two and two together are in the same ratio</em>, <em>and the proportion of them be perturbed</em>, <em>they will also be in the same ratio</em>
       <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>. </p>

<p>Let there be three magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and others equal to them in multitude, which, taken two and two together, are in the same proportion, namely <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>; and let the proportion of them be perturbed, so that, <span class="center">as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>,</span> and, as <em>B</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>E</em>; I say that, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>F</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>D</em> let equimultiples <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>K</em> be taken, and of <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>L</em>, <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>] <span class="center">therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>G</em> to <em>H</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason also, <span class="center">as <em>E</em> is to <em>F</em>, so is <em>M</em> to <em>N</em>.</span> And, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>; <span class="center">therefore also, as <em>G</em> is to <em>H</em>, so is <em>M</em> to <em>N</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Next, since, as <em>B</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>E</em>, alternately, also, as <em>B</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>E</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <em>H</em>, <em>K</em> are equimultiples of <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>, and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples, <span class="center">therefore, as <em>B</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>H</em> to <em>K</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>]</span>
       <pb n="182"/></p>

<p>But, as <em>B</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>E</em>; <span class="center">therefore also, as <em>H</em> is to <em>K</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>E</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>L</em>, <em>M</em> are equimultiples of <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, <span class="center">therefore, as <em>C</em> is to <em>E</em>, so is <em>L</em> to <em>M</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But, as <em>C</em> is to <em>E</em>, so is <em>H</em> to <em>K</em>; <span class="center">therefore also, as <em>H</em> is to <em>K</em>, so is <em>L</em> to <em>M</em>, [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>]</span> and, alternately, as <em>H</em> is to <em>L</em>, so is <em>K</em> to <em>M</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But it was also proved that, <span class="center">as <em>G</em> is to <em>H</em>, so is <em>M</em> to <em>N</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Since, then, there are three magnitudes <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>L</em>, and others equal to them in multitude <em>K</em>, <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of them is perturbed, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, if <em>G</em> is in excess of <em>L</em>, <em>K</em> is also in excess of <em>N</em>; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [<a href="/elem.5.21">V. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And <em>G</em>, <em>K</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>L</em>, <em>N</em> of <em>C</em>, <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
