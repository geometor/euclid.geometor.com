<h1>PROPOSITION 19</h1>
<p><em>If, as a whole is to a whole, so is a part subtracted to a part subtracted</em>, <em>the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole</em>. </p>

<p>For, as the whole <em>AB</em> is to the whole <em>CD</em>, so let the part <em>AE</em> subtracted be to the part <em>CF</em> subtracted; I say that the remainder <em>EB</em> will also be to the remainder <em>FD</em> as the whole <em>AB</em> to the whole <em>CD</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>AE</em> to <em>CF</em>, alternately also, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AE</em>, so is <em>DC</em> to <em>CF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the magnitudes are proportional <em>componendo</em>, they will also be proportional <em>separando</em>, [<a href="/elem.5.17">V. 17</a>] that is, as <em>BE</em> is to <em>EA</em>, so is <em>DF</em> to <em>CF</em>, and, alternately, <span class="center">as <em>BE</em> is to <em>DF</em>, so is <em>EA</em> to <em>FC</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But, as <em>AE</em> is to <em>CF</em>, so by hypothesis is the whole <em>AB</em> to the whole <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore also the remainder <em>EB</em> will be to the remainder <em>FD</em> as the whole <em>AB</em> is to the whole <em>CD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.

<p>From this it is manifest that, if magnitudes be proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>.</p>
