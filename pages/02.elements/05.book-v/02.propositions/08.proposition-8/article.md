<h1>PROPOSITION 8.</h1>
<p><em>Of unequal magnitudes</em>, <em>the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has</em>; <em>and the same has to the less a greater ratio than it has to the greater</em>. <pb n="150"/></p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em> be unequal magnitudes, and let <em>AB</em> be greater; let <em>D</em> be another, chance, magnitude; I say that <em>AB</em> has to <em>D</em> a greater ratio than <em>C</em> has to <em>D</em>, and <em>D</em> has to <em>C</em> a greater ratio than it has to <em>AB</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <em>AB</em> is greater than <em>C</em>, let <em>BE</em> be made equal to <em>C</em>; then the less of the magnitudes <em>AE</em>, <em>EB</em>, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.4">V. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>[<title>Case</title> I.] </p>

<p>First, let <em>AE</em> be less than <em>EB</em>; let <em>AE</em> be multiplied, and let <em>FG</em> be a multiple of it which is greater than <em>D</em>; then, whatever multiple <em>FG</em> is of <em>AE</em>, let <em>GH</em> be made the same multiple of <em>EB</em> and <em>K</em> of <em>C</em>; and let <em>L</em> be taken double of <em>D</em>, <em>M</em> triple of it, and successive multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is a multiple of <em>D</em> and the first that is greater than <em>K</em>. Let it be taken, and let it be <em>N</em> which is quadruple of <em>D</em> and the first multiple of it that is greather than <em>K</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>K</em> is less than <em>N</em> first, therefore <em>K</em> is not less than <em>M</em>. </p>

<p>And, since <em>FG</em> is the same multiple of <em>AE</em> that <em>GH</em> is of <em>EB</em>, therefore <em>FG</em> is the same multiple of <em>AE</em> that <em>FH</em> is of <em>AB</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.1">V. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>FG</em> is the same multiple of <em>AE</em> that <em>K</em> is of <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>FH</em> is the same multiple of <em>AB</em> that <em>K</em> is of <em>C</em>; therefore <em>FH</em>, <em>K</em> are equimultiples of <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>GH</em> is the same multiple of <em>EB</em> that <em>K</em> is of <em>C</em>, and <em>EB</em> is equal to <em>C</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>GH</em> is equal to <em>K</em>.</span>
       <pb n="151"/></p>

<p>But <em>K</em> is not less than <em>M</em>; <span class="center">therefore neither is <em>GH</em> less than <em>M</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And <em>FG</em> is greater than <em>D</em>; therefore the whole <em>FH</em> is greater than <em>D</em>, <em>M</em> together. </p>

<p>But <em>D</em>, <em>M</em> together are equal to <em>N</em>, inasmuch as <em>M</em> is triple of <em>D</em>, and <em>M</em>, <em>D</em> together are quadruple of <em>D</em>, while <em>N</em> is also quadruple of <em>D</em>; whence <em>M</em>, <em>D</em> together are equal to <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>FH</em> is greater than <em>M</em>, <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>FH</em> is in excess of <em>N</em>,</span> while <em>K</em> is not in excess of <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>And <em>FH</em>, <em>K</em> are equimultiples of <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em>, while <em>N</em> is another, chance, multiple of <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AB</em> has to <em>D</em> a greater ratio than <em>C</em> has to <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.7">V. Def. 7</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next, that <em>D</em> also has to <em>C</em> a greater ratio than <em>D</em> has to <em>AB</em>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <em>N</em> is in excess of <em>K</em>, while <em>N</em> is not in excess of <em>FH</em>. </p>

<p>And <em>N</em> is a multiple of <em>D</em>, while <em>FH</em>, <em>K</em> are other, chance, equimultiples of <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>D</em> has to <em>C</em> a greater ratio than <em>D</em> has to <em>AB</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.7">V. Def. 7</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>[<title>Case</title> 2.] </p>

<p>Again, let <em>AE</em> be greater than <em>EB</em>. </p>

<p>Then the less, <em>EB</em>, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.4">V. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be multiplied, and let <em>GH</em> be a multiple of <em>EB</em> and greater than <em>D</em>; and, whatever multiple <em>GH</em> is of <em>EB</em>, let <em>FG</em> be made the same multiple of <em>AE</em>, and <em>K</em>
        of <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Then we can prove similarly that <em>FH</em>, <em>K</em> are equimultiples of <em>AB</em>, <em>C</em>; and, similarly, let <em>N</em> be taken a multiple of <em>D</em> but the first that is greater than <em>FG</em>, so that <em>FG</em> is again not less than <em>M</em>. <pb n="152"/></p>

<p>But <em>GH</em> is greater than <em>D</em>; therefore the whole <em>FH</em> is in excess of <em>D</em>, <em>M</em>, that is, of <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>Now <em>K</em> is not in excess of <em>N</em>, inasmuch as <em>FG</em> also, which is greater than <em>GH</em>, that is, than <em>K</em>, is not in excess of <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>And in the same manner, by following the above argument, we complete the demonstration. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
