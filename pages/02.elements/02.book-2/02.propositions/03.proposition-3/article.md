<p><emph>If a straight line be cut at random</emph>, <emph>the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment</emph>.</p>

===

<h1>Proposition 3.</h1>
<p><em>If a straight line be cut at random</em>, <em>the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment</em>.</p>

<p>For let the straight line <em>AB</em> be cut at random at <em>C</em>; I say that the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the rectangle contained by <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em> together with the square on <em>BC</em>. </p>

<p>For let the square <em>CDEB</em> be described on <em>CB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] let <em>ED</em> be drawn through to <em>F</em>, and through <em>A</em> let <em>AF</em> be drawn parallel to either <em>CD</em> or <em>BE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>]</p>

<p>Then <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>AD</em>, <em>CE</em>.</p>

<p>Now <em>AE</em> is the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, for it is contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BE</em>, and <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>BC</em>;</p>

<p><em>AD</em> is the rectangle <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>, for <em>DC</em> is equal to <em>CB</em>; <span class="center">and <em>DB</em> is the square on <em>CB</em></span>. Therefore the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the rectangle contained by <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em> together with the square on <em>BC</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
