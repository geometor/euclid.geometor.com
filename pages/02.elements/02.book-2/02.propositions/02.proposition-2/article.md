<p><emph>If a straight line be cut at random</emph>, <emph>the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole</emph>.</p>

===

<h1>Proposition 2.</h1>
<p><em>If a straight line be cut at random</em>, <em>the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole</em>.</p>

<p>For let the straight line <em>AB</em> be cut at random at the point <em>C</em>; I say that the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> together with the rectangle contained by <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em> is equal to the square on <em>AB</em>. </p>

<p>For let the square <em>ADEB</em> be described on <em>AB</em> [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>], and let <em>CF</em> be drawn through <em>C</em> parallel to either <em>AD</em> or <em>BE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>]</p>

<p>Then <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>AF</em>, <em>CE</em>.</p>

<p>Now <em>AE</em> is the square on <em>AB</em>;</p>

<p><em>AF</em> is the rectangle contained by <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>, for it is contained by <em>DA</em>, <em>AC</em>, and <em>AD</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>; <span class="center">and <em>CE</em> is the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, for <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>AB</em>.</span></p>

<p>Therefore the rectangle <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em> together with the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the square on <em>AB</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
