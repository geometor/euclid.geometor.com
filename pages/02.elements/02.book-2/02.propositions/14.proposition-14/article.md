<p><emph>To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure</emph>.</p>

===

<h1>Proposition 14.</h1>
<p><em>To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure</em>.</p>

<p>Let <em>A</em> be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure <em>A</em>. 
       <lb n="5"/></p>

<p>For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram <em>BD</em> equal to the rectilineal figure <em>A</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.45">I. 45</a>]</p>

<p>Then, if <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>ED</em>, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square <em>BD</em> has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure <em>A</em>. <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>But, if not, one of the straight lines <em>BE</em>, <em>ED</em> is greater.</p>

<p>Let <em>BE</em> be greater, and let it be produced to <em>F</em>; let <em>EF</em> be made equal to <em>ED</em>, and let <em>BF</em> be bisected at <em>G</em>.</p>

<p>With centre <em>G</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>GB</em>, <em>GF</em> let the semicircle <em>BHF</em> be described; let <em>DE</em> be produced <lb n="15"/>to <em>H</em>, and let <em>GH</em> be joined.</p>

<p>Then, since the straight line <em>BF</em> has been cut into equal segments at <em>G</em>, and into unequal segments at <em>E</em>, <span class="center">the rectangle contained by <em>BE</em>, <em>EF</em> together with the square on <em>EG</em> is equal to the square on <em>GF</em>. [<a href="/elem.2.5">II. 5</a>]</span>
       <lb n="20"/></p>

<p>But <em>GF</em> is equal to <em>GH</em>; therefore the rectangle <em>BE</em>, <em>EF</em> together with the square on <em>GE</em> is equal to the square on <em>GH</em>.</p>

<p>But the squares on <em>HE</em>, <em>EG</em> are equal to the square on <em>GH</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <lb n="25"/>therefore the rectangle <em>BE</em>, <em>EF</em> together with the square on <em>GE</em> is equal to the squares on <em>HE</em>, <em>EG</em>.</p>

<p>Let the square on <em>GE</em> be subtracted from each; <pb n="410"/><span class="center">therefore the rectangle contained by <em>BE</em>, <em>EF</em> which remains is equal to the square on <em>EH</em>.</span>
       <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>But the rectangle <em>BE</em>, <em>EF</em> is <em>BD</em>, for <em>EF</em> is equal to <em>ED</em>; <span class="center">therefore the parallelogram <em>BD</em> is equal to the square on <em>HE</em>.</span></p>

<p>And <em>BD</em> is equal to the rectilineal figure <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore the rectilineal figure <em>A</em> is also equal to the square <lb n="35"/>which can be described on <em>EH</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on <em>EH</em>, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure <em>A</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
