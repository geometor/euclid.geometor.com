To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure.

===

Let `A` be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure `A`.
<!-- <lb n="5"/> -->

For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram `BD` equal to the rectilineal figure `A`. [<a href="/elem.1.45">I. 45</a>]

Then, if `BE` is equal to `ED`, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square `BD` has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure `A`. <lb n="10"/>

But, if not, one of the straight lines `BE`, `ED` is greater.

Let `BE` be greater, and let it be produced to `F`; let `EF` be made equal to `ED`, and let `BF` be bisected at `G`.

With centre `G` and distance one of the straight lines `GB`, `GF` let the semicircle `BHF` be described; let `DE` be produced <lb n="15"/>to `H`, and let `GH` be joined.

Then, since the straight line `BF` has been cut into equal segments at `G`, and into unequal segments at `E`, <span class="center">the rectangle contained by `BE`, `EF` together with the square on `EG` is equal to the square on `GF`. [<a href="/elem.2.5">II. 5</a>]</span>
<!-- <lb n="20"/> -->

But `GF` is equal to `GH`; therefore the rectangle `BE`, `EF` together with the square on `GE` is equal to the square on `GH`.

But the squares on `HE`, `EG` are equal to the square on `GH`; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <lb n="25"/>therefore the rectangle `BE`, `EF` together with the square on `GE` is equal to the squares on `HE`, `EG`.

Let the square on `GE` be subtracted from each; <pb n="410"/><span class="center">therefore the rectangle contained by `BE`, `EF` which remains is equal to the square on `EH`.</span>
<!-- <lb n="30"/> -->

But the rectangle `BE`, `EF` is `BD`, for `EF` is equal to `ED`; <span class="center">therefore the parallelogram `BD` is equal to the square on `HE`.</span>

And `BD` is equal to the rectilineal figure `A`.

Therefore the rectilineal figure `A` is also equal to the square <lb n="35"/>which can be described on `EH`.

Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on `EH`, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure `A`. Q. E. F.
