<p><emph>If a straight line be cut at random</emph>, <emph>the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments</emph>.</p>

===

<h1>Proposition 4.</h1>
<p><em>If a straight line be cut at random</em>, <em>the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments</em>.</p>

<p>For let the straight line <em>AB</em> be cut at random at <em>C</em>; <lb n="5"/>I say that the square on <em>AB</em> is equal to the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em> and twice the rectangle contained by <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>.</p>

<p>For let the square <em>ADEB</em> be described on <em>AB</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] <lb n="10"/>let <em>BD</em> be joined; through <em>C</em> let <em>CF</em> be drawn parallel to either <em>AD</em> or <em>EB</em>, and through <em>G</em> let <em>HK</em> be drawn parallel to either <em>AB</em> or <em>DE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] 
       <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>Then, since <em>CF</em> is parallel to <em>AD</em>, and <em>BD</em> has fallen on them, the exterior angle <em>CGB</em> is equal to the interior and opposite angle <em>ADB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</p>

<p>But the angle <em>ADB</em> is equal to the angle <em>ABD</em>, <lb n="20"/><span class="center">since the side <em>BA</em> is also equal to <em>AD</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span> therefore the angle <em>CGB</em> is also equal to the angle <em>GBC</em>, so that the side <em>BC</em> is also equal to the side <em>CG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>] <pb n="380"/></p>

<p>But <em>CB</em> is equal to <em>GK</em>, and <em>CG</em> to <em>KB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>GK</em> is also equal to <em>KB</em>; <lb n="25"/>therefore <em>CGKB</em> is equilateral.</span></p>

<p>I say next that it is also right-angled.</p>

<p>For, since <em>CG</em> is parallel to <em>BK</em>, <span class="center">the angles <em>KBC</em>, <em>GCB</em> are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span></p>

<p>But the angle <em>KBC</em> is right; <lb n="30"/><span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BCG</em> is also right, so that the opposite angles <em>CGK</em>, <em>GKB</em> are also right. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span></p>

<p>Therefore <em>CGKB</em> is right-angled; and it was also proved equilateral; <span class="center">therefore it is a square; <lb n="35"/> and it is described on <em>CB</em>.</span></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>HF</em> is also a square; and it is described on <em>HG</em>, that is <em>AC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span></p>

<p>Therefore the squares <em>HF</em>, <em>KC</em> are the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>. <lb n="40"/></p>

<p>Now, since <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>GE</em>, and <em>AG</em> is the rectangle <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>, for <em>GC</em> is equal to <em>CB</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>GE</em> is also equal to the rectangle <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>.</span></p>

<p>Therefore <em>AG</em>, <em>GE</em> are equal to twice the rectangle <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>. <lb n="45"/></p>

<p>But the squares <em>HF</em>, <em>CK</em> are also the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>; therefore the four areas <em>HF</em>, <em>CK</em>, <em>AG</em>, <em>GE</em> are equal to the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em> and twice the rectangle contained by <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>.</p>

<p>But <em>HF</em>, <em>CK</em>, <em>AG</em>, <em>GE</em> are the whole <em>ADEB</em>, <lb n="50"/>which is the square on <em>AB</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore the square on <em>AB</em> is equal to the squares on <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em> and twice the rectangle contained by <em>AC</em>, <em>CB</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
