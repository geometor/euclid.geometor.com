To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.

===


Let `AB` be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut `AB` so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.

For let the square `ABDC` be described on `AB`; [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] let `AC` be bisected at the point `E`, and let `BE` be joined; let `CA` be drawn through to `F`, and let `EF` be made equal to `BE`; let the square `FH` be described on `AF`, and let `GH` be drawn through to `K`.

I say that `AB` has been cut at `H` so as to make the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BH` equal to the square on `AH`.

For, since the straight line `AC` has been bisected at `E`, and `FA` is added to it, <span class="center">the rectangle contained by `CF`, `FA` together with the square on `AE` is equal to the square on `EF`. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>]</span>

But `EF` is equal to `EB`; <span class="center">therefore the rectangle `CF`, `FA` together with the square on `AE` is equal to the square on `EB`.</span>

But the squares on `BA`, `AE` are equal to the square on `EB`, for the angle at `A` is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <span class="center">therefore the rectangle `CF`, `FA` together with the square on `AE` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AE`.</span>

Let the square on `AE` be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore the rectangle `CF`, `FA` which remains is equal to the square on `AB`.</span>
<!-- <pb n="403"/> -->

Now the rectangle `CF`, `FA` is `FK`, for `AF` is equal to `FG`; and the square on `AB` is `AD`; <span class="center">therefore `FK` is equal to `AD`.</span>

Let `AK` be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore `FH` which remains is equal to `HD`.</span>

And `HD` is the rectangle `AB`, `BH`, for `AB` is equal to `BD`; and `FH` is the square on `AH`; <span class="center">therefore the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BH` is equal to the square on `HA`. therefore the given straight line `AB` has been cut at `H` so as to make the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BH` equal to the square on `HA`.
