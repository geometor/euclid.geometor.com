<h1>PROPOSITION 17.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">Given two spheres about the same centre</span>, <span class="ital">to inscribe in the greater sphere a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let two spheres be conceived about the same centre <span class="ital">A</span>; thus it is required to inscribe in the greater sphere a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface. 
      </p>

<p>Let the spheres be cut by any plane through the centre; then the sections will be circles, inasmuch as the sphere was produced by the diameter remaining fixed and the semicircle being carried round it; [<a href="/elem.11.def.14">XI. Def. 14</a>] hence, in whatever position we conceive the semicircle to be, the plane carried through it will produce a circle on the circumference of the sphere. </p>

<p>And it is manifest that this circle is the greatest possible, <pb n="426"/>inasmuch as the diameter of the sphere, which is of course the diameter both of the semicircle and of the circle, is greater than all the straight lines drawn across in the circle or the sphere. </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">BCDE</span> be the circle in the greater sphere, and <span class="ital">FGH</span> the circle in the lesser sphere; let two diameters in them, <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span>, be drawn at right angles to one another; then, given the two circles <span class="ital">BCDE</span>, <span class="ital">FGH</span> about the same centre, let there be inscribed in the greater circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span> an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle <span class="ital">FGH</span>, let <span class="ital">BK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>
       <span class="ital">ME</span> be its sides in the quadrant <span class="ital">BE</span>. let <span class="ital">KA</span> be joined and carried through to <span class="ital">N</span>, let <span class="ital">AO</span> be set up from the point <span class="ital">A</span> at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>, and let it meet the surface of the sphere at <span class="ital">O</span>, and through <span class="ital">AO</span> and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">KN</span> let planes be carried; they will then make greatest circles on the surface of the sphere, for the reason stated. </p>

<p>Let them make such, and in them let <span class="ital">BOD</span>, <span class="ital">KON</span> be the semicircles on <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">KN</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">OA</span> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>, therefore all the planes through <span class="ital">OA</span> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>; [<a href="/elem.11.18">XI. 18</a>] hence the semicircles <span class="ital">BOD</span>, <span class="ital">KON</span> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the semicircles <span class="ital">BED</span>, <span class="ital">BOD</span>, <span class="ital">KON</span> are equal, for they are on the equal diameters <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">KN</span>, therefore the quadrants <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">BO</span>, <span class="ital">KO</span> are also equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore there are as many straight lines in the quadrants <span class="ital">BO</span>, <span class="ital">KO</span> equal to the straight lines <span class="ital">BK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">ME</span> as there are sides of the polygon in the quadrant <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>Let them be inscribed, and let them be <span class="ital">BP</span>, <span class="ital">PQ</span>, <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RO</span> and <span class="ital">KS</span>, <span class="ital">ST</span>, <span class="ital">TU</span>, <span class="ital">UO</span>, let <span class="ital">SP</span>, <span class="ital">TQ</span>, <span class="ital">UR</span> be joined, <pb n="427"/>and from <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">S</span> let perpendiculars be drawn to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>; [<a href="/elem.11.11">XI. 11</a>] these will fall on <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">KN</span>, the common sections of the planes, inasmuch as the planes of <span class="ital">BOD</span>, <span class="ital">KON</span> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>. [cf. <a href="/elem.11.def.4">XI. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Let them so fall, and let them be <span class="ital">PV</span>, <span class="ital">SW</span>, and let <span class="ital">WV</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now since, in the equal semicircles <span class="ital">BOD</span>, <span class="ital">KON</span>, equal straight lines <span class="ital">BP</span>, <span class="ital">KS</span> have been cut off, and the perpendiculars <span class="ital">PV</span>, <span class="ital">SW</span> have been drawn, therefore <span class="ital">PV</span> is equal to <span class="ital">SW</span>, and <span class="ital">BV</span> to <span class="ital">KW</span>. [<a href="/elem.3.27">III. 27</a>, <a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] </p>

<p>But the whole <span class="ital">BA</span> is also equal to the whole <span class="ital">KA</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">VA</span> is also equal to the remainder <span class="ital">WA</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">BV</span> is to <span class="ital">VA</span>, so is <span class="ital">KW</span> to <span class="ital">WA</span>; therefore <span class="ital">WV</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">KB</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>And, since each of the straight lines <span class="ital">PV</span>, <span class="ital">SW</span> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">BCDE</span>, therefore <span class="ital">PV</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">SW</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.6">XI. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But it was also proved equal to it; therefore <span class="ital">WV</span>, <span class="ital">SP</span> are also equal and parallel. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">WV</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">SP</span>, while <span class="ital">WV</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">KB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">SP</span> is also parallel to <span class="ital">KB</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.9">XI. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">BP</span>, <span class="ital">KS</span> join their extremities; therefore the quadrilateral <span class="ital">KBPS</span> is in one plane, inasmuch as, if two straight lines be parallel, and points be taken at random on each of them, the straight line joining the points is in the same plane with the parallels. [<a href="/elem.11.7">XI. 7</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason each of the quadrilaterals <span class="ital">SPQT</span>, <span class="ital">TQRU</span> is also in one plane. </p>

<p>But the triangle <span class="ital">URO</span> is also in one plane. [<a href="/elem.11.2">XI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>If then we conceive straight lines joined from the points <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">S</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">T</span>, <span class="ital">R</span>, <span class="ital">U</span> to <span class="ital">A</span>, there will be constructed a certain polyhedral solid figure between the circumferences <span class="ital">BO</span>, <span class="ital">KO</span>, consisting of pyramids of which the quadrilaterals <span class="ital">KBPS</span>, <span class="ital">SPQT</span>, <span class="ital">TQRU</span> and the triangle <span class="ital">URO</span> are the bases and the point <span class="ital">A</span> the vertex. <pb n="428"/></p>

<p>And, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the sides <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">ME</span> as in the case of <span class="ital">BK</span>, and further in the case of the remaining three quadrants, there will be constructed a certain polyhedral figure inscribed in the sphere and contained by pyramids, of which the said quadrilaterals and the triangle <span class="ital">URO</span>, and the others corresponding to them, are the bases and the point <span class="ital">A</span> the vertex. </p>

<p>I say that the said polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere at the surface on which the circle <span class="ital">FGH</span> is. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AX</span> be drawn from the point <span class="ital">A</span> perpendicular to the plane of the quadrilateral <span class="ital">KBPS</span>, and let it meet the plane at the point <span class="ital">X</span>; [<a href="/elem.11.11">XI. 11</a>] let <span class="ital">XB</span>, <span class="ital">XK</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AX</span> is at right angles to the plane of the quadrilateral <span class="ital">KBPS</span>, therefore it is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of the quadrilateral. [<a href="/elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AX</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BX</span>, <span class="ital">XK</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AK</span>, the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>And the squares on <span class="ital">AX</span>, <span class="ital">XB</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, for the angle at <span class="ital">X</span> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] and the squares on <span class="ital">AX</span>, <span class="ital">XK</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">AK</span>. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] </p>

<p>Therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AX</span>, <span class="ital">XB</span> are equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AX</span>, <span class="ital">XK</span>. </p>

<p>Let the square on <span class="ital">AX</span> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">BX</span>, is equal to the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">XK</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BX</span> is equal to <span class="ital">XK</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the straight lines joined from <span class="ital">X</span> to <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">S</span> are equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BX</span>, <span class="ital">XK</span>. <pb n="429"/></p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="ital">X</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="ital">XB</span>, <span class="ital">XK</span> will pass through <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">S</span> also, and <span class="ital">KBPS</span> will be a quadrilateral in a circle. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">KB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">WV</span>, while <span class="ital">WV</span> is equal to <span class="ital">SP</span>, therefore <span class="ital">KB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">SP</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KB</span> is equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">KS</span>, <span class="ital">BP</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">KS</span>, <span class="ital">BP</span> is greater than <span class="ital">SP</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">KBPS</span> is a quadrilateral in a circle, and <span class="ital">KB</span>, <span class="ital">BP</span>, <span class="ital">KS</span> are equal, and <span class="ital">PS</span> less, and <span class="ital">BX</span> is the radius of the circle, therefore the square on <span class="ital">KB</span> is greater than double of the square on <span class="ital">BX</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">KZ</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">K</span> perpendicular to <span class="ital">BV</span>. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">BD</span> is less than double of <span class="ital">DZ</span>, and, as <span class="ital">BD</span> is to <span class="ital">DZ</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="ital">DB</span>, <span class="ital">BZ</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">DZ</span>, <span class="ital">ZB</span>, if a square be described upon <span class="ital">BZ</span> and the parallelogram on <span class="ital">ZD</span> be completed, then the rectangle <span class="ital">DB</span>, <span class="ital">BZ</span> is also less than double of the rectangle <span class="ital">DZ</span>, <span class="ital">ZB</span>. </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">KD</span> be joined, the rectangle <span class="ital">DB</span>, <span class="ital">BZ</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BK</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">DZ</span>, <span class="ital">ZB</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">KZ</span>; [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>, <a href="/elem.6.8 elem.6.8.p.1">VI. 8 and Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">KB</span> is less than double of the square on <span class="ital">KZ</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">KB</span> is greater than double of the square on <span class="ital">BX</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">KZ</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">BX</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KA</span>, the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>And the squares on <span class="ital">BX</span>, <span class="ital">XA</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">BA</span>, and the squares on <span class="ital">KZ</span>, <span class="ital">ZA</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">KA</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">BX</span>, <span class="ital">XA</span> are equal to the squares on <span class="ital">KZ</span>, <span class="ital">ZA</span>, <pb n="430"/>and of these the square on <span class="ital">KZ</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">BX</span>; therefore the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">ZA</span>, is less than the square on <span class="ital">XA</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AX</span> is greater than <span class="ital">AZ</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AX</span> is much greater than <span class="ital">AG</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AX</span> is the perpendicular on one base of the polyhedron, and <span class="ital">AG</span> on the surface of the lesser sphere; hence the polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere on its surface. </p>

<p>Therefore, given two spheres about the same centre, a polyhedral solid has been inscribed in the greater sphere which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface. Q. E. F. </p>
<div id="elem.12.17.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
       
<p>But if in another sphere also a polyhedral solid be inscribed similar to the solid in the sphere <span class="ital">BCDE</span>, the polyhedral solid in the sphere <span class="ital">BCDE</span> has to the polyhedral solid in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter of the sphere <span class="ital">BCDE</span> has to the diameter of the other sphere. </p>

       
<p>For, the solids being divded into their pyramids similar in multitude and arrangement, the pyramids will be similar. </p>

       
<p>But similar pyramids are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides; [<a href="/elem.12.8.p.1">XII. 8, Por.</a>] therefore the pyramid of which the quadrilateral <span class="ital">KBPS</span> is the base, and the point <span class="ital">A</span> the vertex, has to the similarly arranged pyramid in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which the radius <span class="ital">AB</span> of the sphere about <span class="ital">A</span> as centre has to the radius of the other sphere. </p>

       
<p>Similarly also each pyramid of those in the sphere about <span class="ital">A</span> as centre has to each similarly arranged pyramid of those in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AB</span> has to the radius of the other sphere. </p>

       
<p>And, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>] <pb n="431"/>hence the whole polyhedral solid in the sphere about <span class="ital">A</span> as centre has to the whole polyhedral solid in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AB</span> has to the radius of the other sphere, that is, of that which the diameter <span class="ital">BD</span> has to the diameter of the other sphere. Q. E. D.</p>
