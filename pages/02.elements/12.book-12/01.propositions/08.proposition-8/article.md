<p>
       <span class="ital">Similar pyramids which have triangular bases are in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be similar and similarly situated pyramids of <pb n="396"/>which the triangles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, are the bases and the points <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> the vertices; I say that the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCG</span> has to the pyramid <span class="ital">DEFH</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the parallelepipedal solids <span class="ital">BGML</span>, <span class="ital">EHQP</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Now, since the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCG</span> is similar to the pyramid <span class="ital">DEFH</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>, the angle <span class="ital">GBC</span> to the angle <span class="ital">HEF</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">ABG</span> to the angle <span class="ital">DEH</span>; and, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">DE</span>, so is <span class="ital">BC</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>, and <span class="ital">BG</span> to <span class="ital">EH</span>. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">DE</span>, so is <span class="ital">BC</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>, and the sides are proportional about equal angles, therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">BM</span> is similar to the parallelogram <span class="ital">EQ</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">BN</span> is also similar to <span class="ital">ER</span>, and <span class="ital">BK</span> to <span class="ital">EO</span>; therefore the three parallelograms <span class="ital">MB</span>, <span class="ital">BK</span>, <span class="ital">BN</span> are similar to the three <span class="ital">EQ</span>, <span class="ital">EO</span>, <span class="ital">ER</span>. </p>

<p>But the three parallelograms <span class="ital">MB</span>, <span class="ital">BK</span>, <span class="ital">BN</span> are equal and similar to their three opposites, and the three <span class="ital">EQ</span>, <span class="ital">EO</span>, <span class="ital">ER</span> are equal and similar to their three opposites. [<a href="/elem.11.24">XI. 24</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the solids <span class="ital">BGML</span>, <span class="ital">EHQP</span> are contained by similar planes equal in multitude. </p>

<p>Therefore the solid <span class="ital">BGML</span> is similar to the solid <span class="ital">EHQP</span>. </p>

<p>But similar parallelepipedal solids are in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. [<a href="/elem.11.33">XI. 33</a>] <pb n="397"/></p>

<p>Therefore the solid <span class="ital">BGML</span> has to the solid <span class="ital">EHQP</span> the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side <span class="ital">BC</span> has to the corresponding side <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the solid <span class="ital">BGML</span> is to the solid <span class="ital">EHQP</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCG</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">DEFH</span>, inasmuch as the pyramid is a sixth part of the solid, because the prism which is half of the parallelepipedal solid [<a href="/elem.11.28">XI. 28</a>] is also triple of the pyramid. [<a href="/elem.12.7">XII. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCG</span> also has to the pyramid <span class="ital">DEFH</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. Q. E. D. </p>
<div id="elem.12.8.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
       
<p>From this it is manifest that similar pyramids which have polygonal bases are also to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. </p>

       
<p>For, if they are divded into the pyramids contained in them which have triangular bases, by virtue of the fact that the similar polygons forming their bases are also divded into similar triangles equal in multitude and corresponding to the wholes [<a href="/elem.6.20">VI. 20</a>], then, as the one pyramid which has a triangular base in the one complete pyramid is to the one pyramid which has a triangular base in the other complete pyramid, so also will all the pyramids which have triangular bases contained in the one pyramid be to all the pyramids which have triangular bases contained in the other pyramid [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>], that is, the pyramid itself which has a polygonal base to the pyramid which has a polygonal base. </p>

       
<p>But the pyramid which has a triangular base is to the pyramid which has a triangular base in the triplicate ratio of the corresponding sides; therefore also the pyramid which has a polygonal base has to the pyramid which has a similar base the ratio triplicate of that which the side has to the side.</p>
