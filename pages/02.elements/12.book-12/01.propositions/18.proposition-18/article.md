       <hi rend="ital">Spheres are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their respective diameters.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Spheres are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their respective diameters.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the spheres <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span> be conceived, and let <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> be their diameters; I say that the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> has to the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>For, if the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> has not to the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>, then the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> will have either to some less sphere than the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span>, or to a greater, the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>First, let it have that ratio to a less sphere <span class="ital">GHK</span>, let <span class="ital">DEF</span> be conceived about the same centre with <span class="ital">GHK</span>, let there be inscribed in the greater sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere <span class="ital">GHK</span> at its surface, [<a href="/elem.12.17">XII. 17</a>] <pb n="435"/>and let there also be inscribed in the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> a polyhedral solid similar to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span>; therefore the polyhedral solid in <span class="ital">ABC</span> has to the polyhedral solid in <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.12.17.p.1">XII. 17, Por.</a>] 
      </p>

<p>But the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> also has to the sphere <span class="ital">GHK</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore, as the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the sphere <span class="ital">GHK</span>, so is the polyhedral solid in the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span>; and, alternately, as the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the polyhedron in it, so is the sphere <span class="ital">GHK</span> to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> is greater than the polyhedron in it; therefore the sphere <span class="ital">GHK</span> is also greater than the polyhedron in the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span>. </p>

<p>But it is also less, for it is enclosed by it. </p>

<p>Therefore the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> has not to a less sphere than the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. <pb n="436"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither has the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> to a less sphere than the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">EF</span> has to <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that neither has the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> to any greater sphere than the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it have that ratio to a greater, <span class="ital">LMN</span>; therefore, inversely, the sphere <span class="ital">LMN</span> has to the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter <span class="ital">EF</span> has to the diameter <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>But, inasmuch as <span class="ital">LMN</span> is greater than <span class="ital">DEF</span>, therefore, as the sphere <span class="ital">LMN</span> is to the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span>, so is the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> to some less sphere than the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span>, as was before proved. [<a href="/elem.12.2.l.1">XII. 2, Lemma</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> also has to some less sphere than the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">EF</span> has to <span class="ital">BC</span>: which was proved impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> has not to any sphere greater than the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>But it was proved that neither has it that ratio to a less sphere. </p>

<p>Therefore the sphere <span class="ital">ABC</span> has to the sphere <span class="ital">DEF</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">BC</span> has to <span class="ital">EF</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
