<h1>PROPOSITION 14.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one another as their heights.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">EB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> be cylinders on equal bases, the circles <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; I say that, as the cylinder <span class="ital">EB</span> is to the cylinder <span class="ital">FD</span>, so is the axis <span class="ital">GH</span> to the axis <span class="ital">KL</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the axis <span class="ital">KL</span> be produced to the point <span class="ital">N</span>, let <span class="ital">LN</span> be made equal to the axis <span class="ital">GH</span>, and let the cylinder <span class="ital">CM</span> be conceived about <span class="ital">LN</span> as axis. </p>

<p>Since then the cylinders <span class="ital">EB</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> are of the same height, they are to one another as their bases. [<a href="/elem.12.11">XII. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the bases are equal to one another; therefore the cylinders <span class="ital">EB</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> are also equal. </p>

<p>And, since the cylinder <span class="ital">FM</span> has been cut by the plane <span class="ital">CD</span> which is parallel to its opposite planes, therefore, as the cylinder <span class="ital">CM</span> is to the cylinder <span class="ital">FD</span>, so is the axis <span class="ital">LN</span> to the axis <span class="ital">KL</span>. [<a href="/elem.12.13">XII. 13</a>] </p>

<p>But the cylinder <span class="ital">CM</span> is equal to the cylinder <span class="ital">EB</span>, and the axis <span class="ital">LN</span> to the axis <span class="ital">GH</span>; therefore, as the cylinder <span class="ital">EB</span> is to the cylinder <span class="ital">FD</span>, so is the axis <span class="ital">GH</span> to the axis <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the cylinder <span class="ital">EB</span> is to the cylinder <span class="ital">FD</span>, so is the cone <span class="ital">ABG</span> to the cone <span class="ital">CDK</span>. [<a href="/elem.12.10">XII. 10</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the axis <span class="ital">GH</span> is to the axis <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is the cone <span class="ital">ABG</span> to the cone <span class="ital">CDK</span> and the cylinder <span class="ital">EB</span> to the cylinder <span class="ital">FD</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
