<h1>PROPOSITION 13.</h1>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If a cylinder be cut by a plane which is parallel to its opposite planes, then, as the cylinder is to the cylinder, so will the axis be to the axis.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the cylinder <span class="ital">AD</span> be cut by the plane <span class="ital">GH</span> which is parallel to the opposite planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, and let the plane <span class="ital">GH</span> meet the axis at the point <span class="ital">K</span>; I say that, as the cylinder <span class="ital">BG</span> is to the cylinder <span class="ital">GD</span>, so is the axis <span class="ital">EK</span> to the axis <span class="ital">KF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the axis <span class="ital">EF</span> be produced in both directions to the points <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, and let there be set out any number whatever of axes <span class="ital">EN</span>, <span class="ital">NL</span> equal to the axis <span class="ital">EK</span>, and any number whatever <span class="ital">FO</span>, <span class="ital">OM</span> equal to <span class="ital">FK</span>; and let the cylinder <span class="ital">PW</span> on the axis <span class="ital">LM</span> be conceived of which the circles <span class="ital">PQ</span>, <span class="ital">VW</span> are the bases. </p>

<p>Let planes be carried through the points <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> parallel to <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> and to the bases of the cylinder <span class="ital">PW</span>, and let them produce the circles <span class="ital">RS</span>, <span class="ital">TU</span> about the centres <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>Then, since the axes <span class="ital">LN</span>, <span class="ital">NE</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span> are equal to one another, <pb n="418"/>therefore the cylinders <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RB</span>, <span class="ital">BG</span> are to one another as their bases. [<a href="/elem.12.11">XII. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the bases are equal; therefore the cylinders <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RB</span>, <span class="ital">BG</span> are also equal to one another. </p>

<p>Since then the axes <span class="ital">LN</span>, <span class="ital">NE</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span> are equal to one another, and the cylinders <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RB</span>, <span class="ital">BG</span> are also equal to one another, and the multitude of the former is equal to the multitude of the latter, therefore, whatever multiple the axis <span class="ital">KL</span> is of the axis <span class="ital">EK</span>, the same multiple also will the cylinder <span class="ital">QG</span> be of the cylinder <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason, whatever multiple the axis <span class="ital">MK</span> is of the axis <span class="ital">KF</span>, the same multiple also is the cylinder <span class="ital">WG</span> of the cylinder <span class="ital">GD</span>. </p>

<p>And, if the axis <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal to the axis <span class="ital">KM</span>, the cylinder <span class="ital">QG</span> will also be equal to the cylinder <span class="ital">GW</span>, if the axis is greater than the axis, the cylinder will also be greater than the cylinder, and if less, less. </p>

<p>Thus, there being four magnitudes, the axes <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span> and the cylinders <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">GD</span>, there have been taken equimultiples of the axis <span class="ital">EK</span> and of the cylinder <span class="ital">BG</span>, namely the axis <span class="ital">LK</span> and the cylinder <span class="ital">QG</span>, and equimultiples of the axis <span class="ital">KF</span> and of the cylinder <span class="ital">GD</span>, namely the axis <span class="ital">KM</span> and the cylinder <span class="ital">GW</span>; and it has been proved that, if the axis <span class="ital">KL</span> is in excess of the axis <span class="ital">KM</span>, the cylinder <span class="ital">QG</span> is also in excess of the cylinder <span class="ital">GW</span>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the axis <span class="ital">EK</span> is to the axis <span class="ital">KF</span>, so is the cylinder <span class="ital">BG</span> to the cylinder <span class="ital">GD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
