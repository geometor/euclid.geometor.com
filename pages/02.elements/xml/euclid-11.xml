      <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ED</hi> are equal to the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">CE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, and contain equal angles, [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>] therefore the base <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">AED</hi> will be equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">CEB</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] so that the angle <hi rend="ital">DAE</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">EBC</hi>. </p>

[<ref target="elem.1.26" targOrder="U">I. 26</ref>] </p>

      <p>Now since, again, <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> was proved equal to <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is common, the two sides <hi rend="ital">GE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">HE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; and the base <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">GEF</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">HEF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the angles <hi rend="ital">GEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HEF</hi> is right. </p>

      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="ital">FE</hi> will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. </p>

      <p>For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> be in the plane of reference and <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> in one more elevated; let the plane through <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line.

      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also at right angles to the plane through <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>.

      <p>But <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> which is in the plane of reference meets it; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABF</hi> is right. </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is also right; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABF</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>. </p>
      <p>And they are in one plane: which is impossible. </p>

      <p>But each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> is in the plane of reference and meets <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; therefore each of the angles <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ABE</hi> is right. </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the angles <hi rend="ital">CDB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CDE</hi> is also right. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is common, the two sides <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">ED</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>; and they include right angles; therefore the base <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>.

      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is at right angles to the plane <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also at right angles to <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> which is a straight line in the plane <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> produced; [<ref target="elem.11.def.3" targOrder="U">XI.

      <p>Let there be three plane angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, of <pb n="313" />which two, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one, namely <hi rend="center">the angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, the angles <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>,</hi> and, further, the angles <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; let the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> be equal, and let <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> be joined; I say that it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, that is, that any two of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> are greater than the remaining one. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>Now, if the angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> are equal to one another, it is manifest that, <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> being equal also, it is possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, if not, let them be unequal, and on the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, and at the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> on it, let the angle <hi rend="ital">KHL</hi> be constructed equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>; let <hi rend="ital">HL</hi> be made equal to one of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GL</hi> be joined. <figure />

      <p>And, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HL</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, and the angle <hi rend="ital">GHL</hi> is greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, therefore the base <hi rend="ital">GL</hi> is greater than the base <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.24" targOrder="U">I. 24</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> are greater than <hi rend="ital">GL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> are much greater than <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> are greater than the remaining straight line <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>. </p>

      <p>For, if not, <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is either equal to <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, or less. </p>
      <p>First, let it be equal. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">OL</hi> to <hi rend="ital">OM</hi>, the two sides <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OM</hi> respectively; and, by hypothesis, the base <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">LOM</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, and further the angle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi>; <pb n="316" />therefore the three angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> are equal to the three angles <hi rend="ital">LOM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the three angles <hi rend="ital">LOM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi> are equal to four right angles; therefore the angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> are equal to four right angles. </p>
      <p>But they are also, by hypothesis, less than four right angles: which is absurd. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is not equal to <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> less than <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be so, and let <hi rend="ital">OP</hi> be made equal to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">OQ</hi> equal to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi> be joined. </p>

      <p>But <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> was made equal to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is also greater than <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since, then, the two sides <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">PO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OQ</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is greater than the base <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">POQ</hi>.

      <p>Therefore the three angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> are greater than the three angles <hi rend="ital">LOM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi>. </p>

      <p>And it was proved that neither is it equal; therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let then <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> be set up from the point <hi rend="ital">O</hi> at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi>, [<ref target="elem.11.12" targOrder="U">XI. 12</ref>] and let the square on <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> be equal to that area by which the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>; [Lemma] let <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RN</hi> be joined. </p>

      <p>Next, since by hypothesis the square on <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> is equal to that area by which the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>. </p>

      <p>And, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">LR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> is by hypothesis equal to the base <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">LRM</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>.

      <p>For the same reason the parallelograms <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MS</hi> are also equal to one another, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HI</hi>, <hi rend="ital">IN</hi> are equal to one another, and further <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MY</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NT</hi> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the solids <hi rend="ital">LQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AU</hi> three planes are equal to three planes. <pb n="326" /></p>
      <p>But the three planes are equal to the three opposite; therefore the three solids <hi rend="ital">LQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AU</hi> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the three solids <hi rend="ital">ED</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MT</hi> are also equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> is of the base <hi rend="ital">AF</hi>, the same multiple also is the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> of the solid <hi rend="ital">AU</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason, whatever multiple the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> is of the base <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, the same multiple also is the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi> of the solid <hi rend="ital">HU</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, if the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi>, the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>; if the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> exceeds the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi>, the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> also exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>; and, if one falls short, the other falls short. </p>
      <p>Therefore, there being four magnitudes, the two bases <hi rend="ital">AF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, and the two solids <hi rend="ital">AU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UH</hi>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">AU</hi>, namely the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi>, and equimultiples of the base <hi rend="ital">HF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">HU</hi>, namely the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>, and it has been proved that, if the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> exceeds the base <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>, the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> also exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>, if the bases are equal, the solids are equal, and if the base falls short, the solid falls short. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">AU</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">UH</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.def.5" targOrder="U">V. Def. 5</ref>] Q. E. D.</p>

      <p>And, since the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">RUWT</hi> is equal to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">YT</hi> for they are on the same base <hi rend="ital">RT</hi> and in the same parallels <hi rend="ital">RT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">YW</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.35" targOrder="U">I. 35</ref>] while <hi rend="ital">RUWT</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, since it is also equal to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">YT</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>

      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be equal parallelepipedal solids; I say that in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>First, let the sides which stand up, namely <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, be at right angles to their bases; I say that, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>If now the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, while the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> will also be equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. <pb n="346" /></p>
      <p>For parallelepipedal solids of the same height are to one another as the bases; [<ref target="elem.11.32" targOrder="U">XI. 32</ref>] and, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so will <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> be to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, and it is manifest that in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p>Next, let the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> not be equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, but let <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> be greater. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>Now the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> is also greater than <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let then <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> be made equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, and let the parallelepipedal solid <hi rend="ital">VC</hi> be completed on <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi> as base and with <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> as height. </p>
      <p>Now, since the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> is outside them, while equals have to the same the same ratio, [<ref target="elem.5.7" targOrder="U">V. 7</ref>] therefore, as the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, for the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> are of equal height; [<ref target="elem.11.32" targOrder="U">XI. 32</ref>] and, as the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">MQ</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">TQ</hi> [<ref target="elem.11.25" targOrder="U">XI. 25</ref>] and <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>]; therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>. </p>

      <p>Let the sides which stand up be again at right angles to the bases. </p>

      <p>But parallelepipedal solids on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<ref target="elem.11.31" targOrder="U">XI. 31</ref>] therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, let the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> not be equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, but let <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> be greater; therefore the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also greater than the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, that is, <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> be again made equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, and let the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> be similarly completed. </p>
      <p>Since, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>, therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, for the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> are of equal height; [<ref target="elem.11.32" targOrder="U">XI. 32</ref>] and, as <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">MQ</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">QT</hi> [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] and the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.25" targOrder="U">XI. 25</ref>] </p>

      <p>Since the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, for they are on the same base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> and of the same height; [<ref target="elem.11.29 elem.11.30" targOrder="U">XI. 29, 30</ref>] and the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>, for they are again on the same base <hi rend="ital">RO</hi> and of the same height; [<hi rend="ital">id.</hi>] therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>. [Part 1.] </p>
      <p>But the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>. <pb n="349" /></p>
      <p>But the solids <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> and the solids <hi rend="ital">DC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DC</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so let the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; I say that the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, with the same construction, since, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, while the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi> to <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> and <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>. [Part 1.] </p>

      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">DO</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">PE</hi>, the alternate angles <hi rend="ital">DOU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UPE</hi> are equal to one another. [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">DO</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">PE</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">OU</hi> to <hi rend="ital">UP</hi>, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base <hi rend="ital">DU</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">UE</hi>, the triangle <hi rend="ital">DOU</hi> is equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">PUE</hi>, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles; [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">OUD</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">PUE</hi>. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>For this reason <hi rend="ital">DUE</hi> is a straight line. [<ref target="elem.1.14" targOrder="U">I. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason, <hi rend="ital">BSG</hi> is also a straight line, and <hi rend="ital">BS</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">SG</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> is equal and parallel to <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> is also equal and parallel to <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> is also equal and parallel to <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.9" targOrder="U">XI. 9</ref>] <pb n="362" /></p>
      <p>And the straight lines <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> join their extremities; therefore <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">BG</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.33" targOrder="U">I. 33</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">EDT</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">BGT</hi>, for they are alternate; [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] and the angle <hi rend="ital">DTU</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">GTS</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">DTU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GTS</hi> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending one of the equal angles, that is, <hi rend="ital">DU</hi> equal to <hi rend="ital">GS</hi>, for they are the halves of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [<ref target="elem.1.26" targOrder="U">I. 26</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">DT</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">TG</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">UT</hi> to <hi rend="ital">TS</hi>. </p>

      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHKLMN</hi> be two prisms of equal height, let one have the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> as base, and the other the triangle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, and let the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> be double of the triangle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>; I say that the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> is equal to the prism <hi rend="ital">GHKLMN</hi>. <figure />

      <p>For let the solids <hi rend="ital">AO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GP</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Since the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> is double of the triangle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, while the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is also double of the triangle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> is equal to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>. </p>
      <p>But parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<ref target="elem.11.31" targOrder="U">XI. 31</ref>] therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">GP</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> is half of the solid <hi rend="ital">AO</hi>, and the prism <hi rend="ital">GHKLMN</hi> is half of the solid <hi rend="ital">GP</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.28" targOrder="U">XI. 28</ref>] therefore the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> is equal to the prism <hi rend="ital">GHKLMN</hi>. </p>
