<p><emph>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth</emph>, <emph>and also a fifth have to the second the same ratio as a sixth to the fourth</emph>, <emph>the first and fifth added together will have to the second the same ratio as the third and sixth have to the fourth</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth</em>, <em>and also a fifth have to the second the same ratio as a sixth to the fourth</em>, <em>the first and fifth added together will have to the second the same ratio as the third and sixth have to the fourth</em>. </p>

<p>Let a first magnitude <em>AB</em> have to a second <em>C</em> the same ratio as a third <em>DE</em> has to a fourth <em>F</em>; and let also a fifth <em>BG</em> have to  the second <em>C</em> the same ratio as a sixth <em>EH</em> has to the fourth <em>F</em>; I say that the first and fifth added together, <em>AG</em>, will have to the second <em>C</em> the same ratio as the third and sixth, <em>DH</em>, has to the fourth <em>F</em>. <pb n="184"/></p>

<p>For since, as <em>BG</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>EH</em> to <em>F</em>, inversely, as <em>C</em> is to <em>BG</em>, so is <em>F</em> to <em>EH</em>. </p>

<p>Since, then, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>DE</em> to <em>F</em>, <span class="center">and, as <em>C</em> is to <em>BG</em>, so is <em>F</em> to <em>EH</em>,</span> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BG</em>, so is <em>DE</em> to <em>EH</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the magnitudes are proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>; [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] <span class="center">therefore, as <em>AG</em> is to <em>GB</em>, so is <em>DH</em> to <em>HE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But also, as <em>BG</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>EH</em> to <em>F</em>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <em>AG</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>DH</em> to <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
