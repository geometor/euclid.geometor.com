<p><emph>If four magnitudes be proportional</emph>, <emph>they will also be proportional alternately</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If four magnitudes be proportional</em>, <em>they will also be proportional alternately</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>; I say that they will also be so alternately, that is, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>D</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> let equimultiples <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> be taken, and of <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>E</em> is the same multiple of <em>A</em> that <em>F</em> is of <em>B</em>, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>] therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>But as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>; therefore also, as <em>C</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> are equimultiples of <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, therefore, as <em>C</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>G</em> to <em>H</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <em>C</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>; therefore also, as <em>E</em> is to <em>F</em>, so is <em>G</em> to <em>H</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But, if four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be greater than the third, <span class="center">the second will also be greater than the fourth;</span> if equal, equal; and if less, less. [<a href="/elem.5.14">V. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, if <em>E</em> is in excess of <em>G</em>, <em>F</em> is also in excess of <em>H</em>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. <pb n="165"/></p>

<p>Now <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> other, chance, equimultiples of <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="3" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
        
<p><quote><span class="bold">Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D</span>.</quote>
 In a number of expressions like this it is absolutely necessary, when translating into English, to interpolate words which are not in the Greek. Thus the Greek here is: <foreign lang="greek">Ἕστω τέσσαρα μεγέθη ἀνάλογον τὰ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, ὡς τὸ Α πρὸς τὸ Β, οὕτως τὸ Γ πρὸς τὸ Δ</foreign>, literally <quote>Let <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> be four proportional magnitudes, as <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>, so <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>.</quote>
 The same remark applies to the corresponding expressions in the next propositions, <a href="/elem.5.17 elem.5.18">V. 17, 18</a>, and to other forms of expression in <a href="/elem.5.20 elem.5.21 elem.5.22 elem.5.23">V. 20-23</a> and later propositions: e.g. in <a href="/elem.5.20">V. 20</a> we have a phrase meaning literally <quote>Let there be magnitudes...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, as <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>, so <em>D</em> to <em>E</em>,</quote>
 etc.: in <a href="/elem.5.21">V. 21</a> <quote>(magnitudes)...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, and let the proportion of them be perturbed, as <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>, so <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>,</quote>
 etc. In all such cases (where the Greek is so terse as to be almost ungrammatical) I shall insert the words necessary in English, without further remark.</p>
