<p><emph>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth</emph>, <emph>any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively</emph>, <emph>taken in corresponding order</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth</em>, <em>any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively</em>, <em>taken in corresponding order</em>. </p>

<p>For let a first magnitude <em>A</em> have to a second <em>B</em> the same ratio as a third <em>C</em> to a fourth <em>D</em>; and let equimultiples <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> be taken of <em>A</em>, <em>C</em>, and <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> other, chance, equimultiples of <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>; I say that, as <em>E</em> is to <em>G</em>, so is <em>F</em> to <em>H</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let equimultiples <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> be taken of <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, and other, chance, equimultiples <em>M</em>, <em>N</em> of <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>. </p>

<p>Since <em>E</em> is the same multiple of <em>A</em> that <em>F</em> is of <em>C</em>, and equimultiples <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> of <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> have been taken, therefore <em>K</em> is the same multiple of <em>A</em> that <em>L</em> is of <em>C</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.3">V. 3</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>M</em> is the same multiple of <em>B</em> that <em>N</em> is of <em>D</em>.</span>
       <pb n="143"/></p>

<p>And, since, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>, and of <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> equimultiples <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> have been taken, and of <em>B</em>, <em>D</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>, therefore, if <em>K</em> is in excess of <em>M</em>, <em>L</em> also is in excess of <em>N</em>, if it is equal, equal, and if less, less. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>And <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> are equimultiples of <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, and <em>M</em>, <em>N</em> other, chance, equimultiples of <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>; therefore, as <em>E</em> is to <em>G</em>, so is <em>F</em> to <em>H</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
