<h1>PROPOSITION 2.</h1>
<p><em>If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth</em>, <em>and a fifth also be the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the fourth</em>, <em>the sum of the first and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth</em>. </p>

<p>Let a first magnitude, <em>AB</em>, be the same multiple of a second, <em>C</em>, that a third, <em>DE</em>, is of a fourth, <em>F</em>, and let a fifth, <em>BG</em>, also be the same multiple of the second, <em>C</em>, that a sixth, <em>EH</em>, is of the fourth <em>F</em>;  I say that the sum of the first and fifth, <em>AG</em>, will be the same multiple of the second, <em>C</em>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <em>DH</em>, is of the fourth, <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For, since <em>AB</em> is the same multiple of <em>C</em> that <em>DE</em> is of <em>F</em>, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <em>AB</em> equal to <em>C</em>, so many also are there in <em>DE</em> equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason also, as many as there are in <em>BG</em> equal to <em>C</em>, so many are there also in <em>EH</em> equal to <em>F</em>; <pb n="140"/>therefore, as many as there are in the whole <em>AG</em> equal to <em>C</em>, so many also are there in the whole <em>DH</em> equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever multiple <em>AG</em> is of <em>C</em>, that multiple also is <em>DH</em> of <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, <em>AG</em>, is the same multiple of the second, <em>C</em>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <em>DH</em>, is of the fourth, <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q.E.D.</p>
