<p><emph>Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another</em>. </p>

<p>For, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so let <em>C</em> be to <em>D</em>, and, as <em>C</em> is to <em>D</em>, so let <em>E</em> be to <em>F</em>; I say that, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For of <em>A</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>E</em> let equimultiples <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>K</em> be taken, and of <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>F</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>L</em>, <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>Then since, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>, and of <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> equimultiples <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> have been taken, and of <em>B</em>, <em>D</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>L</em>, <em>M</em>, therefore, if <em>G</em> is in excess of <em>L</em>, <em>H</em> is also in excess of <em>M</em>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>

<p>Again, since, as <em>C</em> is to <em>D</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>, and of <em>C</em>, <em>E</em> equimultiples <em>H</em>, <em>K</em> have been taken, and of <em>D</em>, <em>F</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>, therefore, if <em>H</em> is in excess of <em>M</em>, <em>K</em> is also in excess of <em>N</em>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>

<p>But we saw that, if <em>H</em> was in excess of <em>M</em>, <em>G</em> was also in excess of <em>L</em>; if equal, equal; and if less, less; so that, in addition, if <em>G</em> is in excess of <em>L</em>, <em>K</em> is also in excess of <em>N</em>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>

<p>And <em>G</em>, <em>K</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>, while <em>L</em>, <em>N</em> are other, chance, equimultiples of <em>B</em>, <em>F</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
