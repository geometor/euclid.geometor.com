<p><emph>Of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same</emph>, <emph>that which has a greater ratio is greater</emph>; <emph>and that to which the same has a greater ratio is less</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same</em>, <em>that which has a greater ratio is greater</em>; <em>and that to which the same has a greater ratio is less</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>A</em> have to <em>C</em> a greater ratio than <em>B</em> has to <em>C</em>; I say that <em>A</em> is greater than <em>B</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if not, <em>A</em> is either equal to <em>B</em> or less. </p>

<p>Now <em>A</em> is not equal to <em>B</em>; for in that case each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> would have had the same ratio to <em>C</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] but they have not; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is not equal to <em>B</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Nor again is <em>A</em> less than <em>B</em>; for in that case <em>A</em> would have had to <em>C</em> a less ratio than <em>B</em> has to <em>C</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.8">V. 8</a>] but it has not; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is not less than <em>B</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was proved not to be equal either; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is greater than <em>B</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, let <em>C</em> have to <em>B</em> a greater ratio than <em>C</em> has to <em>A</em>; I say that <em>B</em> is less than <em>A</em>. </p>

<p>For, if not, it is either equal or greater. </p>

<p>Now <em>B</em> is not equal to <em>A</em>; for in that case <em>C</em> would have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] but it has not; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is not equal to <em>B</em>.</span>
       <pb n="156"/></p>

<p>Nor again is <em>B</em> greater than <em>A</em>; for in that case <em>C</em> would have had to <em>B</em> a less ratio than it has to <em>A</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.8">V. 8</a>] but it has not; <span class="center">therefore <em>B</em> is not greater than <em>A</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was proved that it is not equal either; <span class="center">therefore <em>B</em> is less than <em>A</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
