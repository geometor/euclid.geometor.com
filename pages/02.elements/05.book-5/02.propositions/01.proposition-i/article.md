<p><emph>If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are</emph>, <emph>respectively</emph>, <emph>equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude</emph>, <emph>then</emph>, <emph>whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one</emph>, <emph>that multiple also will all be of all</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are</em>, <em>respectively</em>, <em>equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one</em>, <em>that multiple also will all be of all</em>. </p>

<p>Let any number of magnitudes whatever <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> be respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> equal in multitude; I say that, whatever multiple <em>AB</em> is of <em>E</em>, that multiple will <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> also be of <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <em>AB</em> is the same multiple of <em>E</em> that <em>CD</em> is of <em>F</em>, as many magnitudes as there are in <em>AB</em> equal to <em>E</em>, so many also are there in <em>CD</em> equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be divded into the magnitudes <em>AG</em>, <em>GB</em> equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>CD</em> into <em>CH</em>, <em>HD</em> equal to <em>F</em>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <em>AG</em>, <em>GB</em> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <em>CH</em>, <em>HD</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>CH</em> to <em>F</em>, therefore <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>AG</em>, <em>CH</em> to <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason </p>

<p><em>GB</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>GB</em>, <em>HD</em> to <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>; therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <em>AB</em> equal to <em>E</em>, so many also are there in <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> equal to <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>; <pb n="139"/>therefore, whatever multiple <em>AB</em> is of <em>E</em>, that multiple will <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> also be of <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
