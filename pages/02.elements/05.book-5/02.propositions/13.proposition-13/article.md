<h1>PROPOSITION 13.</h1>
<p><em>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth</em>, <em>and the third have to the fourth a greater ratio than a fifth has to a sixth</em>, <em>the first will also have to the second a greater ratio than the fifth to the sixth</em>. </p>

<p>For let a first magnitude <em>A</em> have to a second <em>B</em> the same ratio as a third <em>C</em> has to a fourth <em>D</em>, and let the third <em>C</em> have to the fourth <em>D</em> a greater ratio than a fifth <em>E</em> has to a sixth <em>F</em>; I say that the first <em>A</em> will also have to the second <em>B</em> a greater ratio than the fifth <em>E</em> to the sixth <em>F</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since there are some equimultiples of <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, and of <em>D</em>, <em>F</em> other, chance, equimultiples, such that the multiple of <em>C</em> is in excess of the multiple of <em>D</em>, <pb n="161"/>while the multiple of <em>E</em> is not in excess of the multiple of <em>F</em>, [<a href="/elem.5.def.7">V. Def. 7</a>] let them be taken, and let <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> be equimultiples of <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, and <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> other, chance, equimultiples of <em>D</em>, <em>F</em>, so that <em>G</em> is in excess of <em>K</em>, but <em>H</em> is not in excess of <em>L</em>; and, whatever multiple <em>G</em> is of <em>C</em>, let <em>M</em> be also that multiple of <em>A</em>, and, whatever multiple <em>K</em> is of <em>D</em>, let <em>N</em> be also that multiple of <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>, and of <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> equimultiples <em>M</em>, <em>G</em> have been taken, and of <em>B</em>, <em>D</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>N</em>, <em>K</em>, therefore, if <em>M</em> is in excess of <em>N</em>, <em>G</em> is also in excess of <em>K</em>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>G</em> is in excess of <em>K</em>; therefore <em>M</em> is also in excess of <em>N</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>H</em> is not in excess of <em>L</em>; and <em>M</em>, <em>H</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>, and <em>N</em>, <em>L</em> other, chance, equimultiples of <em>B</em>, <em>F</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> has to <em>B</em> a greater ratio than <em>E</em> has to <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.7">V. Def. 7</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
