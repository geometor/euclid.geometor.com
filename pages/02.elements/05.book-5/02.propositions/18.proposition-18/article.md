<h1>PROPOSITION 18.</h1>
<p><em>If magnitudes be proportional</em>
       <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, <em>they will also be proportional</em>
       <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AE</em>, <em>EB</em>, <em>CF</em>, <em>FD</em> be magnitudes proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, so that, as <em>AE</em> is to <em>EB</em>, so is <em>CF</em> to <em>FD</em>;  I say that they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, that is, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>CD</em> to <em>FD</em>. </p>

<p>For, if <em>CD</em> be not to <em>DF</em> as <em>AB</em> to <em>BE</em>, then, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so will <em>CD</em> be either to some magnitude less than <em>DF</em> or to a greater. </p>

<p>First, let it be in that ratio to a less magnitude <em>DG</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>CD</em> to <em>DG</em>, they are magnitudes proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>; <span class="center">so that they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>. [<a href="/elem.5.17">V. 17</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>AE</em> is to <em>EB</em>, so is <em>CG</em> to <em>GD</em>. </p>

<p>But also, by hypothesis, <span class="center">as <em>AE</em> is to <em>EB</em>, so is <em>CF</em> to <em>FD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <em>CG</em> is to <em>GD</em>, so is <em>CF</em> to <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the first <em>CG</em> is greater than the third <em>CF</em>; <span class="center">therefore the second <em>GD</em> is also greater than the fourth <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.14">V. 14</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is not <em>CD</em> to a less magnitude than <em>FD</em>. <pb n="170"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is it in that ratio to a greater; <span class="center">it is therefore in that ratio to <em>FD</em> itself.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
