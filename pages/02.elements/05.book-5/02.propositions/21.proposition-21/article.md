<p><em>If there be three magnitudes</em>, <em>and others equal to them in multitude</em>, <em>which taken two and two together are in the same ratio</em>, <em>and the proportion of them be perturbed</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>if</em><foreign lang="la"> ex aequali</foreign>
       <em>the first magnitude is greater than the third</em>, <em>the fourth will also be greater than the sixth; if equal</em>, <em>equal; and if less</em>, <em>less</em>. </p>

<p>Let there be three magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and others <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, and let the proportion of them be perturbed, so that, <span class="center">as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>,</span> and, as <em>B</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>E</em>, and let <em>A</em> be greater than <em>C</em>
       <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>; I say that <em>D</em> will also be greater than <em>F</em>; if <em>A</em> is equal to <em>C</em>, equal; and if less, less. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <em>A</em> is greater than <em>C</em>, and <em>B</em> is some other magnitude, therefore <em>A</em> has to <em>B</em> a greater ratio than <em>C</em> has to <em>B</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.8">V. 8</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>, and, as <em>C</em> is to <em>B</em>, inversely, so is <em>E</em> to <em>D</em>. Therefore also <em>E</em> has to <em>F</em> a greater ratio than <em>E</em> has to <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.13">V. 13</a>] </p>

<p>But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [<a href="/elem.5.10">V. 10</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>F</em> is less than <em>D</em>; therefore <em>D</em> is greater than <em>F</em>.</span>
       <pb n="179"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that, <span class="center">if <em>A</em> be equal to <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> will also be equal to <em>F</em>;</span> and if less, less. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
