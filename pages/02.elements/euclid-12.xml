    <head>BOOK XII.</head>
    <head>HISTORICAL NOTE.</head>
    <p>The predominant feature of Book XII. is the use of the <hi rend="ital">method of exhaustion</hi>, which is applied in Propositions <ref target="elem.12.2" targOrder="U">2</ref>, <ref target="elem.12.3 elem.12.4 elem.12.5" targOrder="U">3-5</ref>, <ref target="elem.12.10 elem.12.11 elem.12.12" targOrder="U">10, 11, 12</ref>, and (in a slightly different form) in <ref target="elem.12.16 elem.12.17 elem.12.18" targOrder="U">Propositions 16-18</ref>. We conclude therefore that for the content of this Book Euclid was greatly indebted to Eudoxus, to whom the discovery of the method of exhaustion is attributed. The evidence for this attribution comes mainly from Archimedes. (1) In the preface to <title>On the Sphere and Cylinder</title> I., after stating the main results obtained by himself regarding the surface of a sphere or a segment thereof, and the volume and surface of a right cylinder with height equal to its diameter as compared with those of a sphere with the same diameter, Archimedes adds: <quote>Having now discovered that the properties mentioned are true of these figures, I cannot feel any hesitation in setting them side by side both with my former investigations and <hi rend="ital">with those of the theorems of Eudoxus on solids</hi> which are held to be most irrefragably established, namely that <hi rend="ital">any pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height</hi> [i.e. Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.7" targOrder="U">XII. 7</ref>], and that <hi rend="ital">any cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base with the cone and equal height</hi> [i.e. Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.10" targOrder="U">XII. 10</ref>]. For, though these properties also were naturally inherent in the figures all along, yet they were in fact unknown to all the many able geometers who lived before Eudoxus and had not been observed by any one.</quote>
 (2) In the preface to the treatise known as the <title>Quadrature of the Parabola</title> Archimedes states the <quote>lemma</quote>
 assumed by him and known as the <quote>Axiom of Archimedes</quote>
 (see note on <ref target="elem.10.1" targOrder="U">X. 1</ref> above) and proceeds: <quote>Earlier geometers (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ πρότερον γεωμέτραι</foreign>) have also used this lemma; for it is by the use of this same lemma that they have shown that <hi rend="ital">circles are to one another in the duplicate ratio of their diameters</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.2" targOrder="U">XII. 2</ref>], and that <hi rend="ital">spheres are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their diameters</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.18" targOrder="U">XII. 18</ref>], and further that <hi rend="ital">every pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.7" targOrder="U">XII. 7</ref>]; also, that <hi rend="ital">every cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base with the cone and equal height</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.10" targOrder="U">XII. 10</ref>] they proved by assuming <hi rend="ital">a certain lemma similar to that aforesaid</hi>.</quote>
 Thus in the first passage two theorems of Eucl. XII. are definitely attributed to Eudoxus; and, when Archimedes says, in the second passage, that <quote>earlier geometers</quote>
 proved these two theorems by means of the lemma known as the <quote>Axiom of Archimedes</quote>
 and of a lemma similar to it respectively, we can hardly suppose him to be alluding to <pb n="366" />any other proof than that given by Eudoxus. As a matter of fact, the lemma used by Euclid to prove both propositions (<ref target="elem.12.3 elem.12.4 elem.12.5" targOrder="U">XII. 3-5</ref> and <ref target="elem.12.7" targOrder="U">7</ref>, and <ref target="elem.12.10" targOrder="U">XII. 10</ref>) is the theorem of Eucl. <ref target="elem.10.1" targOrder="U">X. 1</ref>. As regards the connexion between the two <quote>lemmas</quote>
 see note on <ref target="elem.10.1" targOrder="U">X. 1</ref>. </p>
    <p>We are not, however, to suppose that none of the <hi rend="ital">results</hi> obtained by the method of exhaustion had been discovered before the time of Eudoxus (fl. about 368-5 B.C.). Two at least are of earlier date, those of <ref target="elem.12.2" targOrder="U">Eucl. XII. 2</ref> and <ref target="elem.12.7" targOrder="U">XII. 7</ref>. </p>
    <p>（<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) Simplicius (<title>Comment. in Aristot. Phys.</title> p. 61, ed. Diels) quotes Eudemus as saying, in his <title>History of Geometry</title>, that Hippocrates of Chios (fl. say 430 B.C.) first laid it down (<foreign lang="greek">ἔθετο</foreign>) that similar segments of circles are in the ratio of the squares on their bases and that he proved this (<foreign lang="greek">ἐδείκνυεν</foreign>) by proving (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ δεῖξαι</foreign>) that the squares on the diameters have the same ratio as the (whole) circles. We know nothing of the method by which Hippocrates proved this proposition; but, having regard to the evidence from Archimedes quoted above, it is not permissible to suppose that the method was the fully developed <hi rend="ital">method of exhaustion</hi> as we know it. </p>
    <p>（<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) As regards the two theorems about the volume of a pyramid and of a cone respectively, which Eudoxus was the first to prove, we now have authentic evidence in the short treatise by Archimedes discovered by Heiberg in a MS. at Constantinople in 1906 and published in <title>Hermes</title> the following year (see now <title>Archimedis opera omnia</title>, ed. Heiberg, 2. ed., Vol. II., 1913, pp. 425-507; T. L. Heath, <title>The Method of Archimedes</title>, Cambridge, 1912). The said treatise, complete in all essentials, bears the title <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρχιμήδους περὶ τῶν μηχανικῶν θεωρημάτων πρὸς Ἐρατοσθένην ἔφοδος</foreign>. This <quote>Method</quote>
 (or <quote>Plan of attack</quote>
), addressed to Eratosthenes, is none other than the <foreign lang="greek">ἐφόδιον</foreign> on which, according to Suidas, Theodosius wrote a commentary, and which is several times cited by Heron in his <title>Metrica</title>; its discovery adds a new and important chapter to the history of the integral calculus. In the preface to this work Archimedes alludes to the theorems which he first discovered by means of mechanical considerations, but proved afterwards by geometry, because the investigation by means of mechanics did not constitute a rigid proof; he observes, however, that the mechanical method is of great use for the <hi rend="ital">discovery</hi> of theorems, and it is much easier to provide the rigid proof when the fact to be proved has once been discovered than it would be if nothing were known to begin with. He goes on: <quote>Hence too, in the case of those theorems the proof of which was first discovered by Eudoxus, namely those relating to the cone and the pyramid, that the cone is one third part of the cylinder, and the pyramid one third part of the prism, having the same base and equal height, no small part of the credit will naturally be assigned to Democritus, who was the first to make the statement (of the fact) regarding the said figure [i.e. property], though without proving it.</quote>
 Hence the <hi rend="ital">discovery</hi> of the two theorems must now be attributed to Democritus (fl. towards the end of 5th cent. B.C.). The words <quote>without proving it</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">χωρὶς ἀποδείξεως</foreign>) do not mean that Democritus gave no sort of proof, but only that he did not give a proof on the rigorous lines required later; for the same words are used by Archimedes of his own investigations by means of mechanics, which, however, do constitute a reasoned argument. The character of Archimedes' mechanical arguments combined with a passage of Plutarch about a particular question in infinitesimals said to have been raised by Democritus may perhaps give a clue to the line of Democritus' argument as regards the pyramid. The essential <pb n="367" />feature of Archimedes' mechanical arguments in this tract is that he regards an area as the sum of an infinite number of <hi rend="ital">siraight lines</hi> parallel to one another and terminated by the boundary or boundaries of the closed figure the area of which is to be found, and a volume as the sum of an infinite number of <hi rend="ital">plane sections</hi> parallel to one another: which is of course the same thing as taking (as we do in the integral calculus) the sum of an infinite number of strips of breadth <hi rend="ital">dx</hi> (say), when <hi rend="ital">dx</hi> becomes indefinitely small, or the sum of an infinite number of parallel laminae of depth <hi rend="ital">dz</hi> (say), when <hi rend="ital">dz</hi> becomes indefinitely small. To give only one instance, we may take the case of the area of a segment of a parabola cut off by a chord. </p>
    <p>Let <hi rend="ital">CBA</hi> be the parabolic segment, <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> the tangent at <hi rend="ital">C</hi> meeting the <figure /> diameter <hi rend="ital">EBD</hi> through the middle point of the chord <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> in <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so that <hi rend="center">.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>Draw <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> parallel to <hi rend="ital">ED</hi> meeting <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> produced in <hi rend="ital">F</hi>. Produce <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> to <hi rend="ital">H</hi> so that , where <hi rend="ital">K</hi> is the point in which <hi rend="ital">CH</hi> meets <hi rend="ital">AF</hi>; and suppose <hi rend="ital">CH</hi> to be a lever. </p>
    <p>Let any diameter <hi rend="ital">MNPO</hi> be drawn meeting the curve in <hi rend="ital">P</hi> and <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> in <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi> respectively. </p>
    <p>Archimedes then observes that <hi rend="center" /> (<quote>for this is proved in a lemma</quote>
), whence <hi rend="center">,</hi> so that, if a straight line <hi rend="ital">TG</hi> equal to <hi rend="ital">PO</hi> be placed with its middle point at <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, the straight line <hi rend="ital">MO</hi> with centre of gravity at <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, and the straight line <hi rend="ital">TG</hi> with centre of gravity at <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, will balance about <hi rend="ital">K</hi>. </p>
    <p>Taking all other parts of diameters like <hi rend="ital">PO</hi> intercepted between the curve and <hi rend="ital">CA</hi>, and placing equal straight lines with their centres of gravity at <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, these straight lines collected at <hi rend="ital">H</hi> will balance (about <hi rend="ital">K</hi>) all the lines like <hi rend="ital">MO</hi> parallel to <hi rend="ital">FA</hi> intercepted within the triangle <hi rend="ital">CFA</hi> in the positions in which they severally lie in the figure. </p>
    <p>Hence Archimedes infers that an area equal to that of the parabolic segment hung at <hi rend="ital">H</hi> will balance (about <hi rend="ital">K</hi>) the triangle <hi rend="ital">CFA</hi> hung at its centre of gravity, the point <hi rend="ital">X</hi> (a point on <hi rend="ital">CK</hi> such that ), and therefore that <hi rend="center"> ,</hi>
     <pb n="368" />from which it follows that <hi rend="center">.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>The same sort of argument is used for solids, <hi rend="ital">plane sections</hi> taking the place of <hi rend="ital">straight lines</hi>. </p>
    <p>Archimedes is careful to state once more that this method of argument does not constitute a <hi rend="ital">proof</hi>. Thus, at the end of the above proposition about the parabolic segment, he adds: <quote>This property is of course not proved by what has just been said; but it has furnished a sort of <hi rend="ital">indication</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμφασίν τινα</foreign>) that the conclusion is true.</quote>
 </p>
    <p>Let us now turn to the passage of Plutarch (<title>De Comm. Not. adv. Stoicos</title> XXXIX 3) about Democritus above referred to. Plutarch speaks of Democritus as having raised the question in natural philosophy (<foreign lang="greek">φυσικῶς</foreign>): <quote>if a cone were cut by a plane parallel to the base [by which is clearly meant a plane indefinitely near to the base], what must we think of the surfaces of the sections, that they are equal or unequal? For, if they are unequal, they will make the cone irregular, as having many indentations, like steps, and unevennesses; but, if they are equal, the sections will be equal, and the cone will appear to have the property of the cylinder and to be made up of equal, not unequal circles, which is very absurd.</quote>
 The phrase <quote><hi rend="ital">made up</hi> of equal...circles</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ἴσων συγκείμενος...κύκλων</foreign>) shows that Democritus already had the idea of a solid being the sum of an infinite number of parallel planes, or indefinitely thin laminae, indefinitely near together: a most important anticipation of the same thought which led to such fruitful results in Archimedes. If then one may hazard a conjecture as to Democritus' argument with regard to a pyramid, it seems probable that he would notice that, if two pyramids of the same height and equal triangular bases are respectively cut by planes parallel to the base and dividing the heights in the same ratio, the corresponding sections of the two pyramids are equal, whence he would infer that the pyramids are equal as being the sum of the same infinite number of equal plane sections or indefinitely thin laminae. (This would be a particular anticipation of Cavalieri's proposition that the areal or solid contents of two figures are equal if two sections of them taken at the same height, whatever the height may be, always give equal straight lines or equal surfaces respectively.) And Democritus would of course see that the three pyramids into which a prism on the same base and of equal height with the original pyramid is divided (as in Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.7" targOrder="U">XII. 7</ref>) satisfy this test of equality, so that the pyramid would be one third part of the prism. The extension to a pyramid with a polygonal base would be easy. And Democritus may have stated the proposition for the cone (of course without an absolute proof) as a natural inference from the result of increasing indefinitely the number of sides in a regular polygon forming the base of a pyramid.<pb n="369" /></p>

       <hi rend="ital">Similar polygons inscribed in circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FGH</hi> be circles, let <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FGHKL</hi> be similar polygons inscribed in them, and let <hi rend="ital">BM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GN</hi> be diameters of the circles; I say that, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">GN</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">FGHKL</hi>. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FN</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the polygon <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> is similar to the polygon <hi rend="ital">FGHKL</hi>, the angle <hi rend="ital">BAE</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">GFL</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">GF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>. [VI. Def. I] </p>
      <p>Thus <hi rend="ital">BAE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GFL</hi> are two triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <hi rend="ital">BAE</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">GFL</hi>, and the sides about the equal angles proportional; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABE</hi> is equiangular with the triangle <hi rend="ital">FGL</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>. <pb n="370" /></p>
      <p>But the angle <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">AMB</hi>, for they stand on the same circumference; [<ref target="elem.3.27" targOrder="U">III. 27</ref>] and the angle <hi rend="ital">FLG</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">FNG</hi>; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">AMB</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">FNG</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the right angle <hi rend="ital">BAM</hi> is also equal to the right angle <hi rend="ital">GFN</hi>; [<ref target="elem.3.31" targOrder="U">III. 31</ref>] therefore the remaining angle is equal to the remaining angle. [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABM</hi> is equiangular with the triangle <hi rend="ital">FGN</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, proportionally, as <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">GN</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> to <hi rend="ital">GF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.4" targOrder="U">VI. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the ratio of the square on <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">GN</hi> is duplicate of the ratio of <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">GN</hi>, and the ratio of the polygon <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">FGHKL</hi> is duplicate of the ratio of <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> to <hi rend="ital">GF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.20" targOrder="U">VI. 20</ref>] therefore also, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">GN</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">FGHKL</hi>. </p>

       <hi rend="ital">Circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be circles, and <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> their diameters; I say that, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>For, if the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is not to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, then, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so will the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> be either to some less area than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, or to a greater. </p>
      <p>First, let it be in that ratio to a less area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; then the inscribed square is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, inasmuch as, if through the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> we draw tangents to the circle, the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is half the square circumscribed about the circle, and the circle is less than the circumscribed square; hence the inscribed square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi> be joined; therefore each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GMH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HNE</hi> is also greater than the half of the segment of the circle about it, inasmuch as, if through the points <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi> we draw tangents to the circle and complete the parallelograms on the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi>, each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EKF</hi>, <pb n="372" /><hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GMH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HNE</hi> will be half of the parallelogram about it, while the segment about it is less than the parallelogram; hence each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GMH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HNE</hi> is greater than the half of the segment of the circle about it. </p>
      <p>Thus, by bisecting the remaining circumferences and joining straight lines, and by doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the circle which will be less than the excess by which the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> exceeds the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>For it was proved in the first theorem of the tenth book that, if two unequal magnitudes be set out, and if from the greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than the half, and from that which is left a greater than the half, and if this be done continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out. </p>
      <p>Let segments be left such as described, and let the segments of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> on <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi> be less than the excess by which the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> exceeds the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the remainder, the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>, is greater than the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let there be inscribed, also, in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> the polygon <hi rend="ital">AOBPCQDR</hi> similar to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>; therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">AOBPCQDR</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.12.1" targOrder="U">XII. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so also is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>; therefore also, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">AOBPCQDR</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>; [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] therefore, alternately, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the polygon inscribed in it, so is the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is greater than the polygon inscribed in it; therefore the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> is also greater than the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>. <pb n="373" /></p>
      <p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is not the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to any area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither is the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> to any area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> as the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to any area greater than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, inversely, as the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, so is the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> to some area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; therefore also, as the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> to some area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>: [<ref target="elem.5.11" targOrder="U">V. 11</ref>] which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is not the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to any area greater than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to any area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>

      <p>Let there be a pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex; I say that the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is divided into two pyramids equal to one another, having triangular bases and similar to the whole pyramid, and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid. <figure />

      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DC</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">HE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Since <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> to <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.2" targOrder="U">VI. 2</ref>] <pb n="379" /></p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is also parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">HEBK</hi> is a parallelogram; therefore <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.34" targOrder="U">I. 34</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EA</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">HD</hi>; therefore the two sides <hi rend="ital">EA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HD</hi> respectively, and the angle <hi rend="ital">EAH</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KHD</hi>; therefore the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEH</hi> is equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKD</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">AHG</hi> is also equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HLD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since two straight lines <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi> meeting one another are parallel to two straight lines <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DL</hi> meeting one another, and are not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<ref target="elem.11.10" targOrder="U">XI. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi> are equal to the two <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DL</hi> respectively, and the angle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>, therefore the base <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.4" targOrder="U">I. 4</ref>] therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is also equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex is equal and similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.11.def.10" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> has been drawn parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, one of the sides of the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi>, <pb n="380" />the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi> is equiangular to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DHK</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.29" targOrder="U">I. 29</ref>] and they have their sides proportional; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DHK</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. Def. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">DBC</hi> is also similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DKL</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADC</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DLH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> meeting one another are parallel to the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HL</hi> meeting one another, not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<ref target="elem.11.10" targOrder="U">XI. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">BAC</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KHL</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> to <hi rend="ital">HL</hi>; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex was proved similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the pyramids <hi rend="ital">AEGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKLD</hi> is similar to the whole pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, since <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is double of the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi>. </p>
      <p>And since, if there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a parallelogram as base, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms are equal, [<ref target="elem.11.39" targOrder="U">XI. 39</ref>] therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <hi rend="ital">BKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi>, and the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EBKH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKFG</hi> is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> and the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">KFCL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LCGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKFG</hi>. </p>
      <p>And it is manifest that each of the prisms, namely that in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is its opposite, and that in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi> is the base and the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> its opposite, is greater than each of the pyramids of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertices, <pb n="381" />inasmuch as, if we join the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">K</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">K</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex; for they are contained by equal and similar planes. </p>
      <p>Hence also the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is equal to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi> is the base and the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> its opposite, and the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Therefore the said two prisms are greater than the said two pyramids of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertices. </p>
      <p>Therefore the whole pyramid, of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex, has been divided into two pyramids equal to one another and into two equal prisms, and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.

      <p>Let there be two pyramids of the same height which have the triangular bases <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, and vertices the points <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, and let each of them be divided into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms; [<ref target="elem.12.3" targOrder="U">XII. 3</ref>] I say that, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are all the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, <pb n="383" /></p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">BO</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">OC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> to <hi rend="ital">LC</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">LO</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is also similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">CO</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> of <hi rend="ital">FV</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CO</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FV</hi>. </p>
      <p>And on <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CO</hi> are described the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>, and on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FV</hi> the similar and similarly situated figures <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>; therefore, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>, so is the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.22" targOrder="U">VI. 22</ref>] therefore, alternately, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>, so is the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite; [Lemma following] therefore also, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite. </p>
      <p>But, as the said prisms are to one another, so is the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KBOL</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">PM</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">QEVR</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">ST</hi> its opposite. [<ref target="elem.11.39" targOrder="U">XI. 39</ref>; cf. <ref target="elem.12.3" targOrder="U">XII. 3</ref>] <pb n="384" /></p>
      <p>Therefore also the two prisms, that in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KBOL</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PM</hi> its opposite, and that in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite, are to the prisms in which <hi rend="ital">QEVR</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">ST</hi> its opposite and in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite in the same ratio [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are the said two prisms to the said two prisms. </p>
      <p>And similarly, if the pyramids <hi rend="ital">PMNG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STUH</hi> be divided into two prisms and two pyramids, as the base <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">STU</hi>, so will the two prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">PMNG</hi> be to the two prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">STUH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the base <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">STU</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; for the triangles <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> are equal to the triangles <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> respectively. </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are the four prisms to the four prisms. </p>
      <p>And similarly also, if we divide the remaining pyramids into two pyramids and into two prisms, then, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so will all the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> be to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. Q. E. D.</p>
      <div4 id="elem.12.4.l.1" type="lemma" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       <head>LEMMA.</head>
       <p>But that, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>, so is the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite, we must prove as follows. </p>
       <p>For in the same figure let perpendiculars be conceived drawn from <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to the planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; these are of course equal because, by hypothesis, the pyramids are of equal height. </p>
       <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> and the perpendicular from <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are cut by the parallel planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, they will be cut in the same ratios. [<ref target="elem.11.17" targOrder="U">XI. 17</ref>] <pb n="385" /></p>
       <p>And <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> is bisected by the plane <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> at <hi rend="ital">N</hi>; therefore the perpendicular from <hi rend="ital">G</hi> to the plane <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> will also be bisected by the plane <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>. </p>
       <p>For the same reason the perpendicular from <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to the plane <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> will also be bisected by the plane <hi rend="ital">STU</hi>. </p>
       <p>And the perpendiculars from <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to the planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> are equal; therefore the perpendiculars from the triangles <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> to the planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> are also equal. </p>

       <p>Hence also the parallelepipedal solids described from the said prisms are of equal height and are to one another as their bases; [<ref target="elem.11.32" targOrder="U">XI. 32</ref>] therefore their halves, namely the said prisms, are to one another as the base <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>.

      </p>
      <p>For, if the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is not to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, then, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so will the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> be either to some solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> or to a greater. </p>

[<ref target="elem.12.3" targOrder="U">XII. 3</ref>] <pb n="387" /></p>
      <p>Again, let the pyramids arising from the division be similarly divided, and let this be done continually until there are left over from the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> some pyramids which are less than the excess by which the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>. [X. I] </p>
      <p>Let such be left, and let them be, for the sake of argument, <hi rend="ital">DQRS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STUH</hi>; therefore the remainders, the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, are greater than the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> also be divided similarly, and a similar number of times, with the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. [<ref target="elem.12.4" targOrder="U">XII. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so also is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>; therefore also, as the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, so are the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>; [V.

[<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is greater than the prisms in it; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> is also greater than the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is not to any solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that neither is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to any solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to any solid greater than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>; therefore, inversely, as the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>. <pb n="388" /></p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, so is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to some solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, as was before proved; [<ref target="elem.12.2.l.1" targOrder="U">XII. 2, Lemma</ref>] therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, so is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to some solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>: [V.

      <p>For let the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Now, since the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is similar to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, the angle <hi rend="ital">GBC</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">HEF</hi>, and the angle <hi rend="ital">ABG</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">DEH</hi>; and, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And since, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, and the sides are proportional about equal angles, therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is similar to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">BN</hi> is also similar to <hi rend="ital">ER</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>; therefore the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">MB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BN</hi> are similar to the three <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ER</hi>. </p>

      <p>But in equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; [<ref target="elem.11.34" targOrder="U">XI. 34</ref>] therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>. </p>

      <p>On each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> let prisms be set up of equal height with the cylinder; then each of the prisms so set up is greater than the half part of that segment of the cylinder which is about it, inasmuch as, if we draw through the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> parallels to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>, complete the parallelograms on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>, and set up from them parallelepipedal solids of equal height with the cylinder, the prisms on the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> are halves of the several solids set up; and the segments of the cylinder are less than the parallelepipedal solids set up; hence also the prisms on the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> are greater than the half of the segments of the cylinder about them. </p>
      <p>Thus, bisecting the circumferences that are left, joining <pb n="402" />straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles prisms of equal height with the cylinder, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cylinder which will be less than the excess by which the cylinder exceeds the triple of the cone.

      <p>Let such segments be left, and let them be <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HA</hi>; therefore the remainder, the prism of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the height is the same as that of the cylinder, is greater than triple of the cone. </p>
      <p>But the prism of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the height the same as that of the cylinder is triple of the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the vertex is the same as that of the cone; [<ref target="elem.12.7.p.1" targOrder="U">XII. 7, Por.</ref>] therefore also the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the vertex is the same as that of the cone is greater than the cone which has the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> as base. </p>
      <p>But it is also less, for it is enclosed by it: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cylinder is not greater than triple of the cone. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the cylinder less than triple of the cone, </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let the cylinder be less than triple of the cone, therefore, inversely, the cone is greater than a third part of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; therefore the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now let there be set up from the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> a pyramid having the same vertex with the cone; therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half part of the cone, seeing that, as we proved before, if we circumscribe a square <pb n="403" />about the circle, the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> will be half of the square circumscribed about the circle, and if we set up from the squares parallelepipedal solids of equal height with the cone, which are also called prisms, the solid set up from the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> will be half of that set up from the square circumscribed about the circle; for they are to one another as their bases. [<ref target="elem.11.32" targOrder="U">XI. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Hence also the thirds of them are in that ratio; therefore also the pyramid of which the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base is half of the pyramid set up from the square circumscribed about the circle. </p>
      <p>And the pyramid set up from the square about the circle is greater than the cone, for it encloses it. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and the vertex is the same with that of the cone is greater than the half of the cone. </p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HA</hi> be joined; therefore also each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> is greater than the half part of that segment of the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> which is about it. </p>

      <p>Thus, by bisecting the circumferences that are left, joining straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles a pyramid which has the same vertex as the cone, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less than the excess by which the cone exceeds the third part of the cylinder.

      </p>
      <p>For, if not, then, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so will the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> be either to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> or to a greater. </p>
      <p>First, let it be in that ratio to a less solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, and let the solid <hi rend="ital">X</hi> be equal to that by which the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi>; therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> is equal to the solids <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, <hi rend="ital">X</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; therefore the square is greater than the half of the circle. </p>
      <p>Let there be set up from the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> a pyramid of equal height with the cone; therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half of the cone, inasmuch as, if we circumscribe a square about the circle, and set up from it a pyramid of equal height with the cone, the inscribed pyramid is half of the circumscribed pyramid, for they are to one another as their bases, [<ref target="elem.12.6" targOrder="U">XII. 6</ref>] while the cone is less than the circumscribed pyramid. <pb n="407" /></p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">HP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SH</hi> be joined. </p>

      <p>Thus, bisecting the circumferences which are left, joining straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles pyramids of equal height with the cone, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less than the solid <hi rend="ital">X</hi>.

      <p>Let there also be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> similar and similarly situated to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>, and on it let a pyramid be set up of equal height with the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since then, as the square on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>, [<ref target="elem.12.1" targOrder="U">XII. 1</ref>] while, as the square on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, [<ref target="elem.12.2" targOrder="U">XII. 2</ref>] therefore also, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>. </p>

      <p>But it is also less: which is absurd. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is not to any solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither is the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> to any solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>

      <p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>; therefore, inversely, as the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> to the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>. </p>

      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; [<ref target="elem.4.6" targOrder="U">IV. 6</ref>] therefore the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>

      <p>And since, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">LKB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NMF</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FM</hi>, and, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FP</hi>, therefore, <hi rend="ital">ex aequali</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FP</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again since, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">LTK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NPM</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LT</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">TK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PM</hi>, and, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">TKB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PMF</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">KT</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">TB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PF</hi>; therefore, <hi rend="ital">ex aequali</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LT</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">TB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] <pb n="413" /></p>
      <p>But it was also proved that, as <hi rend="ital">TB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BL</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">PF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">TL</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">PN</hi> to <hi rend="ital">NF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore in the triangles <hi rend="ital">LTB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NPF</hi> the sides are proportional; therefore the triangles <hi rend="ital">LTB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NPF</hi> are equiangular; [<ref target="elem.6.5" targOrder="U">VI. 5</ref>] hence they are also similar. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. Def. I</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex is also similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex, for they are contained by similar planes equal in multitude. [<ref target="elem.11.def.9" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>But similar pyramids which have triangular bases are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. [<ref target="elem.12.8" targOrder="U">XII. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid <hi rend="ital">BKTL</hi> has to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">FMPN</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FM</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly, by joining straight lines from <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">V</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">U</hi> to <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, and from <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, and setting up on each of the triangles pyramids which have the same vertex with the cones, we can prove that each of the similarly arranged pyramids will also have to each similarly arranged pyramid the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> has to the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">FM</hi>, that is, which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref>] therefore also, as the pyramid <hi rend="ital">BKTL</hi> is to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">FMPN</hi>, so is the whole pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex to the whole pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex; hence also the pyramid of which <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex has to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>
       <pb n="414" />is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex has also to the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>; therefore, as the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex is to the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, so is the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex; therefore, alternately, as the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex is to the pyramid contained in it of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.5.16" targOrder="U">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the said cone is greater than the pyramid in it; for it encloses it. </p>
      <p>Therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is also greater than the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex has not to any solid less than the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>: </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither has the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> to any solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither has the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> to any solid greater than the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it have that ratio to a greater solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, inversely, the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> has to the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is to the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi>, so is the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> also has to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>: which was proved impossible. <pb n="415" /></p>
      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> has not to any solid greater than the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it was proved that neither has it this ratio to a less solid than the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi>. </p>

      <p>But, as the cone is to the cone, so is the cylinder to the cylinder, for the cylinder which is on the same base as the cone and of equal height with it is triple of the cone; [<ref target="elem.12.10" targOrder="U">XII. 10</ref>] therefore the cylinder also has to the cylinder the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>

      <p>Let planes be carried through the points <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi> parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> and to the bases of the cylinder <hi rend="ital">PW</hi>, and let them produce the circles <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TU</hi> about the centres <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>
      <p>Then, since the axes <hi rend="ital">LN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> are equal to one another, <pb n="418" />therefore the cylinders <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> are to one another as their bases.

      <p>But the bases are equal; therefore the cylinders <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> are also equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Since then the axes <hi rend="ital">LN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> are equal to one another, and the cylinders <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> are also equal to one another, and the multitude of the former is equal to the multitude of the latter, therefore, whatever multiple the axis <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is of the axis <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, the same multiple also will the cylinder <hi rend="ital">QG</hi> be of the cylinder <hi rend="ital">GB</hi>. </p>

      <p>Now the cylinder <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> is also equal to the cylinder <hi rend="ital">EP</hi>. </p>

      <p><hi rend="ital">Given two spheres about the same centre</hi>, <hi rend="ital">to inscribe in the greater sphere a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let two spheres be conceived about the same centre <hi rend="ital">A</hi>; thus it is required to inscribe in the greater sphere a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>Let the spheres be cut by any plane through the centre; then the sections will be circles, inasmuch as the sphere was produced by the diameter remaining fixed and the semicircle being carried round it; [<ref target="elem.11.def.14" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 14</ref>] hence, in whatever position we conceive the semicircle to be, the plane carried through it will produce a circle on the circumference of the sphere. </p>
      <p>And it is manifest that this circle is the greatest possible, <pb n="426" />inasmuch as the diameter of the sphere, which is of course the diameter both of the semicircle and of the circle, is greater than all the straight lines drawn across in the circle or the sphere. </p>
      <p>Let then <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi> be the circle in the greater sphere, and <hi rend="ital">FGH</hi> the circle in the lesser sphere; let two diameters in them, <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CE</hi>, be drawn at right angles to one another; then, given the two circles <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FGH</hi> about the same centre, let there be inscribed in the greater circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi> an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle <hi rend="ital">FGH</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>
       <hi rend="ital">ME</hi> be its sides in the quadrant <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. let <hi rend="ital">KA</hi> be joined and carried through to <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> be set up from the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>, and let it meet the surface of the sphere at <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, and through <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KN</hi> let planes be carried; they will then make greatest circles on the surface of the sphere, for the reason stated. </p>
      <p>Let them make such, and in them let <hi rend="ital">BOD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KON</hi> be the semicircles on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KN</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">OA</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>, therefore all the planes through <hi rend="ital">OA</hi> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.18" targOrder="U">XI. 18</ref>] hence the semicircles <hi rend="ital">BOD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KON</hi> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since the semicircles <hi rend="ital">BED</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BOD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KON</hi> are equal, for they are on the equal diameters <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KN</hi>, therefore the quadrants <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KO</hi> are also equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore there are as many straight lines in the quadrants <hi rend="ital">BO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KO</hi> equal to the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ME</hi> as there are sides of the polygon in the quadrant <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let them be inscribed, and let them be <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RO</hi> and <hi rend="ital">KS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ST</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UO</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UR</hi> be joined, <pb n="427" />and from <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi> let perpendiculars be drawn to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.11" targOrder="U">XI. 11</ref>] these will fall on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KN</hi>, the common sections of the planes, inasmuch as the planes of <hi rend="ital">BOD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KON</hi> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>. [cf. <ref target="elem.11.def.4" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let them so fall, and let them be <hi rend="ital">PV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SW</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now since, in the equal semicircles <hi rend="ital">BOD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KON</hi>, equal straight lines <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KS</hi> have been cut off, and the perpendiculars <hi rend="ital">PV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SW</hi> have been drawn, therefore <hi rend="ital">PV</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">SW</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">BV</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KW</hi>. [<ref target="elem.3.27" targOrder="U">III. 27</ref>, <ref target="elem.1.26" targOrder="U">I. 26</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the whole <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is also equal to the whole <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>; therefore the remainder <hi rend="ital">VA</hi> is also equal to the remainder <hi rend="ital">WA</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">BV</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">VA</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">KW</hi> to <hi rend="ital">WA</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.2" targOrder="U">VI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">PV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SW</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">PV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">SW</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.6" targOrder="U">XI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>But it was also proved equal to it; therefore <hi rend="ital">WV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SP</hi> are also equal and parallel. [<ref target="elem.1.33" targOrder="U">I. 33</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">SP</hi> is also parallel to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.9" targOrder="U">XI. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KS</hi> join their extremities; therefore the quadrilateral <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi> is in one plane, inasmuch as, if two straight lines be parallel, and points be taken at random on each of them, the straight line joining the points is in the same plane with the parallels. [<ref target="elem.11.7" targOrder="U">XI. 7</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the quadrilaterals <hi rend="ital">SPQT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TQRU</hi> is also in one plane. </p>
      <p>But the triangle <hi rend="ital">URO</hi> is also in one plane. [<ref target="elem.11.2" targOrder="U">XI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>If then we conceive straight lines joined from the points <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">T</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">U</hi> to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, there will be constructed a certain polyhedral solid figure between the circumferences <hi rend="ital">BO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KO</hi>, consisting of pyramids of which the quadrilaterals <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SPQT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TQRU</hi> and the triangle <hi rend="ital">URO</hi> are the bases and the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the vertex. <pb n="428" /></p>
      <p>And, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the sides <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ME</hi> as in the case of <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, and further in the case of the remaining three quadrants, there will be constructed a certain polyhedral figure inscribed in the sphere and contained by pyramids, of which the said quadrilaterals and the triangle <hi rend="ital">URO</hi>, and the others corresponding to them, are the bases and the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>I say that the said polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere at the surface on which the circle <hi rend="ital">FGH</hi> is. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> be drawn from the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> perpendicular to the plane of the quadrilateral <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi>, and let it meet the plane at the point <hi rend="ital">X</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.11" targOrder="U">XI. 11</ref>] let <hi rend="ital">XB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the quadrilateral <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi>, therefore it is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of the quadrilateral. [<ref target="elem.11.def.3" targOrder="U">XI. Def. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XB</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, for the angle at <hi rend="ital">X</hi> is right; [<ref target="elem.1.47" targOrder="U">I. 47</ref>] and the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>. [<hi rend="ital">id</hi>.] </p>
      <p>Therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XB</hi> are equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder, the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, is equal to the remainder, the square on <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">BX</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the straight lines joined from <hi rend="ital">X</hi> to <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi> are equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. <pb n="429" /></p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <hi rend="ital">X</hi> and distance one of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">XB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi> will pass through <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi> also, and <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi> will be a quadrilateral in a circle. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">WV</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">KS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>; therefore each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">KS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BP</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi> is a quadrilateral in a circle, and <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KS</hi> are equal, and <hi rend="ital">PS</hi> less, and <hi rend="ital">BX</hi> is the radius of the circle, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than double of the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi> be drawn from <hi rend="ital">K</hi> perpendicular to <hi rend="ital">BV</hi>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is less than double of <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, so is the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> to the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZB</hi>, if a square be described upon <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> and the parallelogram on <hi rend="ital">ZD</hi> be completed, then the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> is also less than double of the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZB</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, if <hi rend="ital">KD</hi> be joined, the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, and the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZB</hi> equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>; [<ref target="elem.3.31" targOrder="U">III. 31</ref>, <ref target="elem.6.8 elem.6.8.p.1" targOrder="U">VI. 8 and Por.</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is less than double of the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than double of the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the squares on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XA</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, and the squares on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZA</hi> equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.47" targOrder="U">I. 47</ref>] therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XA</hi> are equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZA</hi>, <pb n="430" />and of these the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>; therefore the remainder, the square on <hi rend="ital">ZA</hi>, is less than the square on <hi rend="ital">XA</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">AZ</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is much greater than <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is the perpendicular on one base of the polyhedron, and <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> on the surface of the lesser sphere; hence the polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere on its surface. </p>
      <p>Therefore, given two spheres about the same centre, a polyhedral solid has been inscribed in the greater sphere which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface. Q. E. F. </p>

       <p>But if in another sphere also a polyhedral solid be inscribed similar to the solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>, the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi> has to the polyhedral solid in the other sphere the ratio triplicate of that which the diameter of the sphere <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi> has to the diameter of the other sphere. </p>
       <p>For, the solids being divided into their pyramids similar in multitude and arrangement, the pyramids will be similar. </p>

      <p>Let the spheres <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> be conceived, and let <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> be their diameters; I say that the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has to the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has not to the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, then the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> will have either to some less sphere than the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, or to a greater, the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>First, let it have that ratio to a less sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> be conceived about the same centre with <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, let there be inscribed in the greater sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> at its surface, [<ref target="elem.12.17" targOrder="U">XII. 17</ref>] <pb n="435" />and let there also be inscribed in the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> a polyhedral solid similar to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; therefore the polyhedral solid in <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has to the polyhedral solid in <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.12.17.p.1" targOrder="U">XII. 17, Por.</ref>] <figure />
