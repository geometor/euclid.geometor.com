<p><span class="ital">If in an equilateral and equiangular pentagon straight lines subtend two angles taken in order</span>, <span class="ital">they cut one another in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">and their greater segments are equal to the side of the pentagon.</span>
      </p>

<p>For in the equilateral and equiangular pentagon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> let the straight lines <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>, cutting one another at the point <span class="ital">H</span>, subtend two angles taken in order, the angles at <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that each of them has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point <span class="ital">H</span>, and their greater segments are equal to the side of the pentagon. 
      </p>

<p>For let the circle <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> be circumscribed about the pentagon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span>. [<a href="/elem.4.14">IV. 14</a>] <pb n="454"/></p>

<p>Then, since the two straight lines <span class="ital">EA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are equal to the two <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">BE</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">AC</span>, the triangle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">BAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">AHE</span> is double of the angle <span class="ital">BAH</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">EAC</span> is also double of the angle <span class="ital">BAC</span>, inasmuch as the circumference <span class="ital">EDC</span> is also double of the circumference <span class="ital">CB</span>; [<a href="/elem.3.28">III. 28</a>, <a href="/elem.6.33">VI. 33</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">HAE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">AHE</span>; hence the straight line <span class="ital">HE</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">EA</span>, that is, to <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the straight line <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AE</span>, the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">AEB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> was proved equal to the angle <span class="ital">BAH</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">BEA</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">BAH</span>. </p>

<p>And the angle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="ital">ABE</span> and <span class="ital">ABH</span>; therefore the remaining angle <span class="ital">BAE</span> is equal to the remaining angle <span class="ital">AHB</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">ABH</span>; therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">EB</span> is to <span class="ital">BA</span>, so is <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">BH</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EH</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">BE</span> is to <span class="ital">EH</span>, so is <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">HB</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">BE</span> is greater than <span class="ital">EH</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">HB</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.14">V. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BE</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">H</span>, and the greater segment <span class="ital">HE</span> is equal to the side of the pentagon. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">AC</span> has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">H</span>, and its greater segment <span class="ital">CH</span> is equal to the side of the pentagon. Q. E. D.<pb n="455"/></p>
