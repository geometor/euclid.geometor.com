<h1>PROPOSITION 9.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If the side of the hexagon and that of the decagon inscribed in the same circle be added together</span>, <span class="ital">the whole straight line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">and its greater segment is the side of the hexagon.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABC</span> be a circle; of the figures inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">ABC</span> let <span class="ital">BC</span> be the side of a decagon, <span class="ital">CD</span> that of a hexagon, and let them be in a straight line; I say that the whole straight line <span class="ital">BD</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <span class="ital">CD</span> is its greater segment. 
      </p>

<p>For let the centre of the circle, the point <span class="ital">E</span>, be taken, let <span class="ital">EB</span>, <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> be joined, and let <span class="ital">BE</span> be carried through to <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">BC</span> is the side of an equilateral decagon, <pb n="456"/>therefore the circumference <span class="ital">ACB</span> is five times the circumference <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore the circumference <span class="ital">AC</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the circumference <span class="ital">AC</span> is to <span class="ital">CB</span>, so is the angle <span class="ital">AEC</span> to the angle <span class="ital">CEB</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.33">VI. 33</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">AEC</span> is quadruple of the angle <span class="ital">CEB</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the angle <span class="ital">EBC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">ECB</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">AEC</span> is double of the angle <span class="ital">ECB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the straight line <span class="ital">EC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CD</span>, for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">ABC</span>, [<a href="/elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>] the angle <span class="ital">CED</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">CDE</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">ECB</span> is double of the angle <span class="ital">EDC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">AEC</span> was proved double of the angle <span class="ital">ECB</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">AEC</span> is quadruple of the angle <span class="ital">EDC</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">AEC</span> was also proved quadruple of the angle <span class="ital">BEC</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">EDC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">BEC</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">EBD</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="ital">BEC</span> and <span class="ital">BED</span>; therefore the remaining angle <span class="ital">BED</span> is also equal to the remaining angle <span class="ital">ECB</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="ital">EBD</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">EBC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BE</span>, so is <span class="ital">EB</span> to <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">BD</span> is to <span class="ital">DC</span>, so is <span class="ital">DC</span> to <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">BD</span> is greater than <span class="ital">DC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DC</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line <span class="ital">BD</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <span class="ital">DC</span> is its greater segment. Q. E. D.</p>
