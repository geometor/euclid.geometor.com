<p><span class="ital">To construct an octahedron and comprehend it in a sphere</span>, <span class="ital">as in the preceding case</span>; <span class="ital">and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double of the square on the side of the octahedron.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the diameter <span class="ital">AB</span> of the given sphere be set out, and let it be bisected at <span class="ital">C</span>; let the semicircle <span class="ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">CD</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">C</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">DB</span> be joined; let the square <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, having each of its sides equal to <span class="ital">DB</span>, be set out, let <span class="ital">HF</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span> be joined, from the point <span class="ital">K</span> let the straight line <span class="ital">KL</span> be set up at right angles to the plane of the square <span class="ital">EFGH</span> [<a href="/elem.11.12">XI. 12</a>], and let it be carried through to the other side of the plane, as <span class="ital">KM</span>; from the straight lines <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> let <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> be respectively cut off equal to one of the straight lines <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, and let <span class="ital">LE</span>, <span class="ital">LF</span>, <span class="ital">LG</span>, <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">ME</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span>, <span class="ital">MH</span> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">KE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KH</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">EKH</span> is right, therefore the square on <span class="ital">HE</span> is double of the square on <span class="ital">EK</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">LK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KE</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">LKE</span> is right, therefore the square on <span class="ital">EL</span> is double of the square on <span class="ital">EK</span>. [<span class="ital">id.</span>] <pb n="475"/></p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">HE</span> was also proved double of the square on <span class="ital">EK</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">LE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EH</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EH</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">LH</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">HE</span>; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">LEH</span> is equilateral. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that each of the remaining triangles of which the sides of the square <span class="ital">EFGH</span> are the bases, and the points <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> the vertices, is equilateral; therefore an octahedron has been constructed which is contained by eight equilateral triangles. </p>

<p>It is next required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double of the square on the side of the octahedron. </p>

<p>For, since the three straight lines <span class="ital">LK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> are equal to one another, therefore the semicircle described on <span class="ital">LM</span> will also pass through <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>And for the same reason, if, <span class="ital">LM</span> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through the points <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, and the octahedron will have been comprehended in a sphere. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also comprehended in the given sphere. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">LK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KM</span>, while <span class="ital">KE</span> is common, and they contain right angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">LE</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">EM</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the angle <span class="ital">LEM</span> is right, for it is in a semicircle, [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">LM</span> is double of the square on <span class="ital">LE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of <span class="ital">BC</span>. <pb n="476"/></p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">LM</span> was also proved double of the square on <span class="ital">LE</span>. </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">DB</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">LE</span>, for <span class="ital">EH</span> was made equal to <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="ital">LM</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LM</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore <span class="ital">LM</span> is equal to the diameter of the given sphere. </p>

<p>Therefore the octahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere, and it has been demonstrated at the same time that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double of the square on the side of the octahedron. Q. E. D.</p>
