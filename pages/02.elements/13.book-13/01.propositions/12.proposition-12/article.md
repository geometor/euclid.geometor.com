<p><span class="ital">If an equilateral triangle be inscribed in a circle</span>, <span class="ital">the square on the side of the triangle is triple of the square on the radius of the circle.</span>
       <pb n="467"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABC</span> be a circle, and let the equilateral triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> be inscribed in it; I say that the square on one side of the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is triple of the square on the radius of the circle. 
      </p>

<p>For let the centre <span class="ital">D</span> of the circle <span class="ital">ABC</span> be taken, let <span class="ital">AD</span> be joined and carried through to <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">BE</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equilateral, therefore the circumference <span class="ital">BEC</span> is a third part of the circumference of the circle <span class="ital">ABC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the circumference <span class="ital">BE</span> is a sixth part of the circumference of the circle; therefore the straight line <span class="ital">BE</span> belongs to a hexagon; therefore it is equal to the radius <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AE</span> is double of <span class="ital">DE</span>, the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">ED</span>, that is, of the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>; [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>, <a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span> are quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on the side of the triangle is triple of the square on the radius. Q. E. D.</p>
