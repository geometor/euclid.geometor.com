<h1>PROPOSITION 17.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">To construct a dodecahedron and comprehend it in a sphere</span>, <span class="ital">like the aforesaid figures, and to prove that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABCD</span>, <span class="ital">CBEF</span>, two planes of the aforesaid cube at right angles to one another, be set out, let the sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, <span class="ital">FC</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> respectively, let <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">HL</span>, <span class="ital">MH</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> be joined, let the straight lines <span class="ital">NP</span>, <span class="ital">PO</span>, <span class="ital">HQ</span> be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the points <span class="ital">R</span>, <span class="ital">S</span>, <span class="ital">T</span> respectively, and let <span class="ital">RP</span>, <span class="ital">PS</span>, <span class="ital">TQ</span> be their greater segments; from the points <span class="ital">R</span>, <span class="ital">S</span>, <span class="ital">T</span> let <span class="ital">RU</span>, <span class="ital">SV</span>, <span class="ital">TW</span> be set up at right angles to the planes of the cube towards the outside of the cube, let them be made equal to <span class="ital">RP</span>, <span class="ital">PS</span>, <span class="ital">TQ</span>, and let <span class="ital">UB</span>, <span class="ital">BW</span>, <span class="ital">WC</span>, <span class="ital">CV</span>, <span class="ital">VU</span> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>I say that the pentagon <span class="ital">UBWCV</span> is equilateral, and in one plane, and is further equiangular. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">RB</span>, <span class="ital">SB</span>, <span class="ital">VB</span> be joined. <pb n="494"/></p>

<p>Then, since the straight line <span class="ital">NP</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">R</span>, and <span class="ital">RP</span> is the greater segment, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">PN</span>, <span class="ital">NR</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">RP</span>. [<a href="/elem.13.4">XIII. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">PN</span> is equal to <span class="ital">NB</span>, and <span class="ital">PR</span> to <span class="ital">RU</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">BN</span>, <span class="ital">NR</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">RU</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">BR</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">BN</span>, <span class="ital">NR</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">BR</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">RU</span>; hence the squares on <span class="ital">BR</span>, <span class="ital">RU</span> are quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">RU</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">BU</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">BR</span>, <span class="ital">RU</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BU</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">RU</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BU</span> is double of <span class="ital">RU</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">VU</span> is also double of <span class="ital">UR</span>, inasmuch as <span class="ital">SR</span> is also double of <span class="ital">PR</span>, that is, of <span class="ital">RU</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BU</span> is equal to <span class="ital">UV</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BW</span>, <span class="ital">WC</span>, <span class="ital">CV</span> is also equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BU</span>, <span class="ital">UV</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the pentagon <span class="ital">BUVCW</span> is equilateral. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also in one plane. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">PX</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">P</span> parallel to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">RU</span>, <span class="ital">SV</span> and towards the outside of the cube, and let <span class="ital">XH</span>, <span class="ital">HW</span> be joined; I say that <span class="ital">XHW</span> is a straight line. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">HQ</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">T</span>, and <span class="ital">QT</span> is its greater segment, therefore, as <span class="ital">HQ</span> is to <span class="ital">QT</span>, so is <span class="ital">QT</span> to <span class="ital">TH</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">HQ</span> is equal to <span class="ital">HP</span>, and <span class="ital">QT</span> to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">TW</span>, <span class="ital">PX</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">HP</span> is to <span class="ital">PX</span>, so is <span class="ital">WT</span> to <span class="ital">TH</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">HP</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">TW</span>, for each of them is at right angles to the plane <span class="ital">BD</span>; [<a href="/elem.11.6">XI. 6</a>] and <span class="ital">TH</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">PX</span>, for each of them is at right angles to the plane <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] <pb n="495"/></p>

<p>But if two triangles, as <span class="ital">XPH</span>, <span class="ital">HTW</span>, which have two sides proportional to two sides be placed together at one angle so that their corresponding sides are also parallel, the remaining straight lines will be in a straight line; [<a href="/elem.6.32">VI. 32</a>] therefore <span class="ital">XH</span> is in a straight line with <span class="ital">HW</span>. </p>

<p>But every straight line is in one plane; [<a href="/elem.11.1">XI. 1</a>] therefore the pentagon <span class="ital">UBWCV</span> is in one plane. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>

<p>For, since the straight line <span class="ital">NP</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">R</span>, and <span class="ital">PR</span> is the greater segment, while <span class="ital">PR</span> is equal to <span class="ital">PS</span>, therefore <span class="ital">NS</span> has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">P</span>, and <span class="ital">NP</span> is the greater segment; [<a href="/elem.13.5">XIII. 5</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">NS</span>, <span class="ital">SP</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">NP</span>. [<a href="/elem.13.4">XIII. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">NP</span> is equal to <span class="ital">NB</span>, and <span class="ital">PS</span> to <span class="ital">SV</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">NS</span>, <span class="ital">SV</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">NB</span>; hence the squares on <span class="ital">VS</span>, <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NB</span> are quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">NB</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">SB</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NB</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">BS</span>, <span class="ital">SV</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">BV</span> —for the angle <span class="ital">VSB</span> is right—is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">NB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">VB</span> is double of <span class="ital">BN</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BC</span> is also double of <span class="ital">BN</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BV</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">BU</span>, <span class="ital">UV</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">BW</span>, <span class="ital">WC</span>, and the base <span class="ital">BV</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">BUV</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">BWC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the angle <span class="ital">UVC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">BWC</span>; therefore the three angles <span class="ital">BWC</span>, <span class="ital">BUV</span>, <span class="ital">UVC</span> are equal to one another. <pb n="496"/></p>

<p>But if in an equilateral pentagon three angles are equal to one another, the pentagon will be equiangular, [<a href="/elem.13.7">XIII. 7</a>] therefore the pentagon <span class="ital">BUVCW</span> is equiangular. </p>

<p>And it was also proved equilateral; therefore the pentagon <span class="ital">BUVCW</span> is equilateral and equiangular, and it is on one side <span class="ital">BC</span> of the cube. </p>

<p>Therefore, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the twelve sides of the cube, a solid figure will have been constructed which is contained by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, and which is called a dodecahedron. </p>

<p>It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">XP</span> be produced, and let the produced straight line be <span class="ital">XZ</span>; therefore <span class="ital">PZ</span> meets the diameter of the cube, and they bisect one another, for this has been proved in the last theorem but one of the eleventh book. [<a href="/elem.11.38">XI. 38</a>] </p>

<p>Let them cut at <span class="ital">Z</span>; therefore <span class="ital">Z</span> is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube, and <span class="ital">ZP</span> is half of the side of the cube. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">UZ</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since the straight line <span class="ital">NS</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">P</span>, and <span class="ital">NP</span> is its greater segment, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">NS</span>, <span class="ital">SP</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">NP</span>. [<a href="/elem.13.4">XIII. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">NS</span> is equal to <span class="ital">XZ</span>, inasmuch as <span class="ital">NP</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">PZ</span>, and <span class="ital">XP</span> to <span class="ital">PS</span>. </p>

<p>But further <span class="ital">PS</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">XU</span>, since it is also equal to <span class="ital">RP</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">ZX</span>, <span class="ital">XU</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">NP</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">UZ</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">ZX</span>, <span class="ital">XU</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">UZ</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">NP</span>. <pb n="497"/></p>

<p>But the square on the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube is also triple of the square on the half of the side of the cube, for it has previously been shown how to construct a cube and comprehend it in a sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. [<a href="/elem.13.15">XIII. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But, if whole is so related to whole, so is half to half also; and <span class="ital">NP</span> is half of the side of the cube; therefore <span class="ital">UZ</span> is equal to the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">Z</span> is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube; therefore the point <span class="ital">U</span> is on the surface of the sphere. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere; therefore the dodecahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere. </p>

<p>I say next that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p>

<p>For since, when <span class="ital">NP</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">RP</span> is the greater segment, and, when <span class="ital">PO</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">PS</span> is the greater segment, therefore, when the whole <span class="ital">NO</span> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">RS</span> is the greater segment. </p>

<p>[Thus, since, as <span class="ital">NP</span> is to <span class="ital">PR</span>, so is <span class="ital">PR</span> to <span class="ital">RN</span>, the same is true of the doubles also, for parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples; [<a href="/elem.5.15">V. 15</a>] therefore as <span class="ital">NO</span> is to <span class="ital">RS</span>, so is <span class="ital">RS</span> to the sum of <span class="ital">NR</span>, <span class="ital">SO</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">NO</span> is greater than <span class="ital">RS</span>; therefore <span class="ital">RS</span> is also greater than the sum of <span class="ital">NR</span>, <span class="ital">SO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">NO</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <span class="ital">RS</span> is its greater segment.] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">RS</span> is equal to <span class="ital">UV</span>; therefore, when <span class="ital">NO</span> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">UV</span> is the greater segment. <pb n="498"/></p>

<p>And, since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is triple of the square on the side of the cube, therefore <span class="ital">NO</span>, being a side of the cube, is rational. </p>

<p>[But if a rational line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, each of the segments is an irrational apotome.] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">UV</span>, being a side of the dodecahedron, is an irrational apotome. [<a href="/elem.13.6">XIII. 6</a>] </p>

<p>From this it is manifest that, when the side of the cube is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is the side of the dodecahedron. Q. E. D.</p>
