<h1>PROPOSITION 10.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If an equilateral pentagon be inscribed in a circle</span>, <span class="ital">the square on the side of the pentagon is equal to the squares on the side of the hexagon and on that of the decagon inscribed in the same circle.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> be a circle, and let the equilateral pentagon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> be inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">ABCDE</span>. </p>

<p>I say that the square on the side of the pentagon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> is equal to the squares on the side of the hexagon and on that of the decagon inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">ABCDE</span>. </p>

<p>For let the centre of the circle, the point <span class="ital">F</span>, be taken, let <span class="ital">AF</span> be joined and carried through to the point <span class="ital">G</span>, let <span class="ital">FB</span> be joined, let <span class="ital">FH</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">F</span> perpendicular to <span class="ital">AB</span> and be carried through to <span class="ital">K</span>, <pb n="458"/>let <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">KB</span> be joined, let <span class="ital">FL</span> be again drawn from <span class="ital">F</span> perpendicular to <span class="ital">AK</span>, and be carried through to <span class="ital">M</span>, and let <span class="ital">KN</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Since the circumference <span class="ital">ABCG</span> is equal to the circumference <span class="ital">AEDG</span>, and in them <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AED</span>, therefore the remainder, the circumference <span class="ital">CG</span>, is equal to the remainder <span class="ital">GD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CD</span> belongs to a pentagon; therefore <span class="ital">CG</span> belongs to a decagon. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">FA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FB</span>, and <span class="ital">FH</span> is perpendicular, therefore the angle <span class="ital">AFK</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">KFB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>, <a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Hence the circumference <span class="ital">AK</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">KB</span>; [<a href="/elem.3.26">III. 26</a>] therefore the circumference <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of the circumference <span class="ital">BK</span>; therefore the straight line <span class="ital">AK</span> is a side of a decagon. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">AK</span> is also double of <span class="ital">KM</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since the circumference <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of the circumference <span class="ital">BK</span>, while the circumference <span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to the circumference <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore the circumference <span class="ital">CD</span> is also double of the circumference <span class="ital">BK</span>. </p>

<p>But the circumference <span class="ital">CD</span> is also double of <span class="ital">CG</span>; therefore the circumference <span class="ital">CG</span> is equal to the circumference <span class="ital">BK</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">BK</span> is double of <span class="ital">KM</span>, since <span class="ital">KA</span> is so also; therefore <span class="ital">CG</span> is also double of <span class="ital">KM</span>. <pb n="459"/></p>

<p>But, further, the circumference <span class="ital">CB</span> is also double of the circumference <span class="ital">BK</span>, for the circumference <span class="ital">CB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BA</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the whole circumference <span class="ital">GB</span> is also double of <span class="ital">BM</span>; hence the angle <span class="ital">GFB</span> is also double of the angle <span class="ital">BFM</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.33">VI. 33</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">GFB</span> is also double of the angle <span class="ital">FAB</span>, for the angle <span class="ital">FAB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">ABF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">BFN</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">FAB</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">ABF</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="ital">ABF</span> and <span class="ital">BFN</span>; therefore the remaining angle <span class="ital">AFB</span> is equal to the remaining angle <span class="ital">BNF</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ABF</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">BFN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BF</span>, so is <span class="ital">FB</span> to <span class="ital">BN</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BN</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AL</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LK</span>, while <span class="ital">LN</span> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">KN</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">AN</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">LKN</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">LAN</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">LAN</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KBN</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">LKN</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">KBN</span>. </p>

<p>And the angle at <span class="ital">A</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="ital">AKB</span> and <span class="ital">AKN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the remaining angle <span class="ital">AKB</span> is equal to the remaining angle <span class="ital">KNA</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="ital">KBA</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">KNA</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as the straight line <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AK</span>, so is <span class="ital">KA</span> to <span class="ital">AN</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AN</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AK</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BN</span> was also proved equal to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>; <pb n="460"/>therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BN</span> together with the rectangle <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AN</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> [<a href="/elem.2.2">II. 2</a>], is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">BA</span> is a side of the pentagon, <span class="ital">BF</span> of the hexagon [<a href="/elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>], and <span class="ital">AK</span> of the decagon. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
