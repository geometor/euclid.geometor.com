<p><span class="ital">If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">the square on the lesser segment added to the half of the greater segment is five times the square on the half of the greater segment.</span>
       <pb n="446"/></p>

<p>For let any straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point <span class="ital">C</span>, let <span class="ital">AC</span> be the greater segment, and let <span class="ital">AC</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the square <span class="ital">AE</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let the figure be drawn double. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">AC</span> is double of <span class="ital">DC</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, that is, <span class="ital">RS</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, and <span class="ital">CE</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">RS</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">RS</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CE</span> is also quadruple of <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">KF</span>. </p>

<p>Hence the square <span class="ital">GF</span> is also equal to the square <span class="ital">HL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">GK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KL</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MN</span> to <span class="ital">NE</span>; hence <span class="ital">MF</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">FE</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">MF</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CG</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">FE</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">CN</span> be added to each; therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">OPQ</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CE</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CE</span> was proved quadruple of <span class="ital">GF</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">OPQ</span> is also quadruple of the square <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">OPQ</span> and the square <span class="ital">FG</span> are five times <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>But the gnomon <span class="ital">OPQ</span> and the square <span class="ital">FG</span> are the square <span class="ital">DN</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DN</span> is the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>, and <span class="ital">GF</span> the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">DB</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>. Q. E. D.<pb n="447"/></p>
