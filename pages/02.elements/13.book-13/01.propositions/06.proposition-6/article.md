Let `AB` be a rational straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at `C`, and let `AC` be the greater segment; I say that each of the straight lines `AC`, `CB` is the irrational straight line called apotome.

For let `BA` be produced, and let `AD` be made half of `BA`.

Since then the straight line `AB` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and to the greater segment `AC` is added `AD` which is half of `AB`, therefore the square on `CD` is five times the square on `DA`. [<a href="/elem.13.1">XIII. 1</a>]

Therefore the square on `CD` has to the square on `DA` the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on `CD` is commensurable with the square on `DA`. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>]

But the square on `DA` is rational, for `DA` is rational, being half of `AB` which is rational; therefore the square on `CD` is also rational; [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore `CD` is also rational.

And, since the square on `CD` has not to the square on `DA` the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore `CD` is incommensurable in length with `DA`; [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore `CD`, `DA` are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore `AC` is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>]

Again, since `AB` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and `AC` is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `AC`. [<a href="/elem.6.def.3">VI. Def. 3</a>, <a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>]

Therefore the square on the apotome `AC`, if applied to the rational straight line `AB`, produces `BC` as breadth.

But the square on an apotome, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a first apotome; [<a href="/elem.10.97">X. 97</a>] therefore `CB` is a first apotome. <pb n="451"/>

And `CA` was also proved to be an apotome.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
