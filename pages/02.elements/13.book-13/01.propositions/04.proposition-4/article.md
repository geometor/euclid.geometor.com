<h1>PROPOSITION 4.</h1>
<p><span class="ital">If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">the square on the whole and the square on the lesser segment together are triple of the square on the greater segment.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">C</span>, and let <span class="ital">AC</span> be the greater segment; I say that the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the square <span class="ital">ADEB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let the figure be drawn. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">C</span>, and <span class="ital">AC</span> is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.3">VI. Def. 3</a>, <a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AK</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">HG</span> the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">HG</span>. <pb n="448"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AF</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FE</span>, let <span class="ital">CK</span> be added to each; therefore the whole <span class="ital">AK</span> is equal to the whole <span class="ital">CE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span> are double of <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span> are the gnomon <span class="ital">LMN</span> and the square <span class="ital">CK</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">LMN</span> and the square <span class="ital">CK</span> are double of <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">AK</span> was also proved equal to <span class="ital">HG</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">LMN</span> and the squares <span class="ital">CK</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> are triple of the square <span class="ital">HG</span>. </p>

<p>And the gnomon <span class="ital">LMN</span> and the squares <span class="ital">CK</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> are the whole square <span class="ital">AE</span> and <span class="ital">CK</span>, which are the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, while <span class="ital">HG</span> is the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are triple of the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
