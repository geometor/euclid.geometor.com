       <hi rend="ital">If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be even, the whole will be even.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be even, the whole will be even.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let as many odd numbers as we please, <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, even in multitude, be added together; I say that the whole <span class="ital">AE</span> is even. <pb n="414"/></p>

<p>For, since each of the numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is odd, if an unit be subtracted from each, each of the remainders will be even; [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] so that the sum of them will be even. [<a href="/elem.9.21">IX. 21</a>] 
      </p>

<p>But the multitude of the units is also even. </p>

<p>Therefore the whole <span class="ital">AE</span> is also even. [<a href="/elem.9.21">IX. 21</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
