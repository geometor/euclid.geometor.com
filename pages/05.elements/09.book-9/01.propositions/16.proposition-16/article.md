       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, the second will not be to any other number as the first is to the second.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, the second will not be to any other number as the first is to the second.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be prime to one another; I say that <span class="ital">B</span> is not to any other number as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so let <span class="ital">B</span> be to <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> as antecedent antecedent. </p>

<p>But it also measures itself; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> which are prime to one another: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> will not be to <span class="ital">C</span>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
