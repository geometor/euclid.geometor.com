===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If from an even number an odd number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.</span>
      </p>

<p>For from the even number <span class="ital">AB</span> let the odd number <span class="ital">BC</span> be subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="ital">CA</span> is odd. 
      </p>

<p>For let the unit <span class="ital">CD</span> be subtracted from <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DB</span> is even. [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is also even; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">AD</span> is also even. [<a href="/elem.9.24">IX. 24</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CD</span> is an unit; therefore <span class="ital">CA</span> is odd. [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
