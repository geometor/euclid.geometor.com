<p><hi rend="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, and the number after the unit be prime, the greatest will not be measured by any except those which have a place among the proportional numbers</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, and the number after the unit be prime, the greatest will not be measured by any except those which have a place among the proportional numbers</span>. </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, beginning from an unit and in continued proportion, and let <span class="ital">A</span>, the number after the unit, be prime; I say that <span class="ital">D</span>, the greatest of them, will not be measured by any other number except <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be measured by <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">E</span> not be the same with any of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>It is then manifest that <span class="ital">E</span> is not prime. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">E</span> is prime and measures <span class="ital">D</span>, it will also measure <span class="ital">A</span> [<a href="/elem.9.12">IX. 12</a>], which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible. <pb n="400"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is not prime. </p>

<p>Therefore it is composite. </p>

<p>But any composite number is measured by some prime number; [<a href="/elem.7.31">VII. 31</a>] therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is measured by some prime number. </p>

<p>I say next that it will not be measured by any other prime except <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">E</span> is measured by another, and <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, that other will also measure <span class="ital">D</span>; so that it will also measure <span class="ital">A</span> [<a href="/elem.9.12">IX. 12</a>], which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, let it measure it according to <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">F</span> is not the same with any of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">F</span> is the same with one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, and measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> also measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>But one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to some one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; [<a href="/elem.9.11">IX. 11</a>] therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is also the same with one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>: which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">F</span> is not the same as any one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">F</span> is measured by <span class="ital">A</span>, by proving again that <span class="ital">F</span> is not prime. </p>

<p>For, if it is, and measures <span class="ital">D</span>, it will also measure <span class="ital">A</span> [<a href="/elem.9.12">IX. 12</a>], which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> is not prime. </p>

<p>Therefore it is composite. </p>

<p>But any composite number is measured by some prime number; [<a href="/elem.7.31">VII. 31</a>] therefore <span class="ital">F</span> is measured by some prime number. <pb n="401"/></p>

<p>I say next that it will not be measured by any other prime except <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>For, if any other prime number measures <span class="ital">F</span>, and <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, that other will also measure <span class="ital">D</span>; so that it will also measure <span class="ital">A</span> [<a href="/elem.9.12">IX. 12</a>], which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to <span class="ital">F</span>, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">A</span> has also by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> made <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.9.11">IX. 11</a>] therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">F</span> also measures <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let it measure it according to <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly, then, we can prove that <span class="ital">G</span> is not the same with any of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, and that it is measured by <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">F</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> according to <span class="ital">G</span> therefore <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">G</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">A</span> has also by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> made <span class="ital">C</span>; [<a href="/elem.9.11">IX. 11</a>] therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Let it measure it according to <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly then we can prove that <span class="ital">H</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">G</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to <span class="ital">H</span>, therefore <span class="ital">G</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">H</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But further <span class="ital">A</span> has also by multiplying itself made <span class="ital">B</span>; [<a href="/elem.9.8">IX. 8</a>] therefore the product of <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">H</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] <pb n="402"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">G</span>;&lt; therefore <span class="ital">H</span> also measures <span class="ital">A</span>, which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span> the greatest will not be measured by any other number except <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
