       <hi rend="ital">If a number have its half odd, it is even-times odd only.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number have its half odd, it is even-times odd only.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> have its half odd; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is even-times odd only. 
      </p>

<p>Now that it is even-times odd is manifest; for the half of it, being odd, measures it an even number of times. [<a href="/elem.7.def.9">VII. Def. 9</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also even-times odd only. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">A</span> is even-times even also, it will be measured by an even number according to an even number; [<a href="/elem.7.def.8">VII. Def. 8</a>] so that the half of it will also be measured by an even number though it is odd: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is even-times odd only. Q. E. D.</p>
