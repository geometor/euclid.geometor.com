<p>
       <span class="ital">If three numbers in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, any two whatever added together will be prime to the remaining number.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, three numbers in continued proportion, be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that any two of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> whatever added together are prime to the remaining number, namely <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">A</span>; and further <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let two numbers <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, be taken. [<a href="/elem.8.2">VIII. 2</a>] </p>

<p>It is then manifest that <span class="ital">DE</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">A</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">EF</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>, and, further, <span class="ital">EF</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.2">VIII. 2</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are least, they are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.7.22">VII. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But, if two numbers be prime to one another, their sum is also prime to each; [<a href="/elem.7.28">VII. 28</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DF</span> is also prime to each of the numbers <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>But further <span class="ital">DE</span> is also prime to <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> are prime to <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>But, if two numbers be prime to any number, their product is also prime to the other; [<a href="/elem.7.24">VII. 24</a>] so that the product of <span class="ital">FD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is prime to <span class="ital">EF</span>; hence the product of <span class="ital">FD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is also prime to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.25">VII. 25</a>] </p>

<p>But the product of <span class="ital">FD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is the square on <span class="ital">DE</span> together with the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>; [<a href="/elem.2.3">II. 3</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">DE</span> together with the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> is prime to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">DE</span> is <span class="ital">A</span>, the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> is <span class="ital">B</span>, and the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> added together are prime to <span class="ital">C</span>. <pb n="405"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> added together are prime to <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> added together are also prime to <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">DF</span> is prime to each of the numbers <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, the square on <span class="ital">DF</span> is also prime to the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.24 elem.7.25">VII. 24, 25</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> together with twice the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">DF</span>; [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> together with twice the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are prime to the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p><foreign lang="la">Separando</foreign>, the squares on <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> together with once the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are prime to the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign> again, the squares on <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> are prime to the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">DE</span> is <span class="ital">A</span>, the product of <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> is <span class="ital">B</span>, and the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> added together are prime to <span class="ital">B</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
