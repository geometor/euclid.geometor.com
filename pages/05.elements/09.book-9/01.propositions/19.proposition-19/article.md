===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Given three numbers, to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the given three numbers, and let it be required to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them. 
      </p>

<p>Now either they are not in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are prime to one another; or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are not prime to one another; or they are not in continued proportion, nor are the extremes of them prime to one another; or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are prime to one another. </p>

<p>If then <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number to them. [<a href="/elem.9.17">IX. 17</a>] </p>

<p>&lt;*&gt;Next, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> not be in continued proportion, the extremes being again prime to one another; I say that in this case also it is impossible to find a fourth proportional to them. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">D</span> have been found, so that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>,</span> and let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> as antecedent antecedent. <pb n="410"/></p>

<p>But it also measures itself; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>.&lt;*&gt; </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be again in continued proportion, but let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> not be prime to one another. </p>

<p>I say that it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them. </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> either measures <span class="ital">D</span> or does not measure it. </p>

<p>First, let it measure it according to <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">B</span> has also by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> made <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] therefore <span class="ital">E</span> has been found a fourth proportional to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span> not measure <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">E</span> have been found; therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to <span class="ital">E</span>, so that <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But it also does not measure it: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional number to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> when <span class="ital">A</span> does not measure <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> not be in continued proportion, nor the extremes prime to one another. </p>

<p>And let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly then it can be proved that, if <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>, it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them, but, if it does not measure it, impossible. Q. E. D.</p>
