       <hi rend="ital">If four numbers be proportional, they will also be proportional alternately.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If four numbers be proportional, they will also be proportional alternately.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the four numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be proportional, so that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>;</span> I say that they will also be proportional alternately, so that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so will <span class="ital">B</span> be to <span class="ital">D</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">B</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">D</span> also. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Therefore, alternately, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">B</span> of <span class="ital">D</span> also. [<a href="/elem.7.10">VII. 10</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
