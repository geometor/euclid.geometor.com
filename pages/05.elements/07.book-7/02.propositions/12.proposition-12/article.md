       <hi rend="ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in proportion, then, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in proportion, then, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be as many numbers as we please in proportion, so that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>;</span> I say that, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so are <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">B</span>, the same part or parts is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">D</span> also. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also the sum of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is the same part or the same parts of the sum of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> that <span class="ital">A</span> is of <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.5 elem.7.6">VII. 5, 6</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so are <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>]</p>
