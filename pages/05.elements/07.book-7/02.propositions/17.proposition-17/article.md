       <hi rend="ital">If a number by multiplying two numbers make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the numbers multiplied.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number by multiplying two numbers make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the numbers multiplied.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying the two numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>; I say that, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>. 
      </p>

<p>But the unit <span class="ital">F</span> also measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it; therefore the unit <span class="ital">F</span> measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the unit <span class="ital">F</span> is to the number <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason, as the unit <span class="ital">F</span> is to the number <span class="ital">A</span>, so also is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, alternately, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.13">VII. 13</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
