       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers by multiplying any number make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the multipliers.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers by multiplying any number make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the multipliers.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying any number <span class="ital">C</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>; I say that, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore also <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">A</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.16">VII. 16</a>] For the same reason also <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the number <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>]</p>
