       <hi rend="ital">If two numbers be prime to two numbers, both to each, their products also will be prime to one another.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers be prime to two numbers, both to each, their products also will be prime to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be prime to the two numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; both to each, and let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> make <span class="ital">F</span>; I say that <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are prime to one another. 
      </p>

<p>For, since each of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is prime to <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> will also be prime to <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.24">VII. 24</a>] </p>

<p>But the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are also prime to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore each of the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is prime to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> will also be prime to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.24">VII. 24</a>] </p>

<p>But the product of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
