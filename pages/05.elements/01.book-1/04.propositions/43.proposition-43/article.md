In any parallelogram the complements [^1]  of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.

===

Let `ABCD` be a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter; and about `AC` let `EH`, `FG` be parallelograms, and `BK`, `KD` [^2] the so-called complements;

I say that the complement `BK` is equal to the complement `KD`.

For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter, 

- the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `ACD`. [1.34]

Again, since `EH` is a parallelogram, and `AK` is its diameter, 

- the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`.

For the same reason 

- the triangle `KFC` is also equal to `KGC`.

Now, since the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`, 

- and `KFC` to `KGC`,

the triangle `AEK` together with `KGC` is equal to the triangle `AHK` together with `KFC`. [1.c.n.2]

And the whole triangle `ABC` is also equal to the whole `ADC`; therefore the complement `BK` which remains is equal to the complement `KD` which remains. [1.c.n.3]

Therefore etc.

    Euclid's phraseology here and in the next proposition implies that the complements as well as the other parallelograms are <quote>about</quote> the diagonal. The words are here <foreign lang="greek">περὶ δὲ τὴν ΑΓ παραλληλόγραμμα μὲν ἔστω τὰ ΕΘ, ΖΗ, τὰ δὲ λεγόμενα παραπληρώματα τὰ ΒΚ, ΚΔ</foreign>. The expression <quote>the so-called complements</quote> indicates that this technical use of <foreign lang="greek">παραπληρώματα</foreign> was not new, though it might not be universally known.
