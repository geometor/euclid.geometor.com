To bisect a given rectilineal angle.

===

Let the angle `BAC` be the given rectilineal angle.

Thus it is required to bisect it.

Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AB`; let `AE` be cut off from `AC` equal to `AD`; [I.3] let `DE` be joined, and on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `DEF` be constructed; let `AF` be joined. 

I say that the angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.

For, since `AD` is equal to `AE`, and `AF` is common, 

- the two sides `DA`, `AF` are equal to the two sides `EA`, `AF` respectively.

And the base `DF` is equal to the base `EF`; 

- therefore the angle `DAF` is equal to the angle `EAF`. [I.8]

Therefore the given rectilineal angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.
