Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary [^I.22:2] that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. [I.20] [^I.22:1] [^I.22:3]

===

Let the three given straight lines be `A`, `B`, `C`, and of these let two taken together in any manner be greater than the remaining one, namely `A`, `B` greater than `C`,

- `A`, `C` greater than `B`,

nd `B`, `C` greater than `A`; thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.


Let there be set out a straight line `DE`, terminated at `D` but of infinite length in the direction of `E`, and let `DF` be made equal to `A`, `FG` equal to `B`, and `GH` equal to `C`. [I.3]

With centre `F` and distance `FD` let the circle `DKL` be described; again, with centre `G` and distance `GH` let the circle `KLH` be described; and let `KF`, `KG` be joined;

I say that the triangle `KFG` has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.

For, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `DKL`,

- `FD` is equal to `FK`.

But `FD` is equal to `A`;

- therefore `KF` is also equal to `A`.

Again, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `LKH`,

- `GH` is equal to `GK`.

But `GH` is equal to `C`;

- therefore `KG` is also equal to `C`. And `FG` is also equal to `B`;

therefore the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK` are equal to the three straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`.

Therefore out of the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK`, which are equal to the three given straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`, the triangle `KFG` has been constructed.

[^I.22:1]: enunciation note
    This is the first case in the <title>Elements</title> of a <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> to a problem in the sense of a statement of the conditions or limits of the possibility of a solution. The criterion is of course supplied by the preceding proposition.

[^I.22:2]: thus it is necessary.
    This is usually translated (e.g. by Williamson and Simson) <quote><title>But</title> it is necessary,</quote> which is however inaccurate, since the Greek is not <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δέ</foreign> but <foreign lang="greek">δεῖ δή</foreign>. The words are the same as those used to introduce the <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> in the other sense of the <quote>definition</quote> or <quote>particular statement</quote> of a construction to be effected. Hence, as in the latter case we say <quote>thus it is required</quote> (e.g. to bisect the finite straight line `AB`, <a href="/elem.1.10">I. 10</a>), we should here translate <quote><em>thus</em> it is necessary.</quote>

[^I.22:3]: enunciation note
    To this enunciation all the MSS. and Boethius add, after the <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign>, the words <quote>because in any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.</quote>
    But this explanation has the appearance of a gloss, and it is omitted by Proclus and Campanus. Moreover there is no corresponding addition to the <foreign lang="greek">διορισμός</foreign> of <a href="/elem.6.28">VI. 28</a>.
