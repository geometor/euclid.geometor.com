To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.

===

Let `A` be the given point, and `BC` the given straight line.

Thus it is required to place at the point `A` (as an extremity)[^I.2:1] a straight line equal to the given straight line `BC`. 

From the point `A` to the point `B` let the straight line `AB` be joined; [I.post.1] and on it let the equilateral triangle `DAB` be constructed. [I.1]

Let the straight lines `AE`, `BF` be produced[^I.2:2] in a straight line with `DA`, `DB`; [I.post.2] with centre `B` and distance `BC` let the circle `CGH` be described; [I.post.3] and again, with centre `D` and distance `DG` let the circle `GKL` be described. [I.post.3]

Then, since the point `B` is the centre of the circle `CGH`, 

- `BC` is equal to `BG`.

Again, since the point `D` is the centre of the circle `GKL`, 

- `DL` is equal to `DG`.

And in these `DA` is equal to `DB`; 

- therefore the remainder `AL` is equal to the remainder `BG`[^I.2:3]. [I.c.n.3]

But `BC` was also proved equal to `BG`; 

- therefore each of the straight lines `AL`, `BC` is equal to `BG`.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [I.c.n.1] 

- therefore `AL` is also equal to `BC`.

Therefore at the given point `A` the straight line `AL` is placed equal to the given straight line `BC`.

- (Being) what it was required to do.

## Footnotes

[^I.2:1]: (as an extremity).
    I have inserted these words because <quote>to place a straight line <em>at</em> a given point</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τῷ δοθέντι σημείῳ</foreign>) is not quite clear enough, at least in English.

[^I.2:2]: Let the straight lines AE, BF be produced....
    It will be observed that in this first application of <a href="/elem.1.post.2">Postulate 2</a>, and again in <a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>, Euclid speaks of the <em>continuation</em> of the straight line as that which is produced in such cases, <foreign lang="greek">ἐκβεβλήσθωσαν</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">προσεκβεβλήσθωσαν</foreign> meaning little more than <em>drawing</em> straight lines <quote>in a straight line with</quote> the given straight lines. The first place in which Euclid uses phraseology exactly corresponding to ours when <pb n="245"/>speaking of a straight line being produced is in <a href="/elem.1.16">I. 16</a>: <quote>let one side of it, `BC`, be produced to `D`</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">προσεκβεβλήσθω αὐτοῦ μία πλευρὰ ἡ ΒΓ ἐπὶ τὸ Δ</foreign>).

[^I.2:3]: the remainder AL...the remainder BG.
    The Greek expressions are <foreign lang="greek">λοιπὴ ἡ ΑΛ</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λοιπῇ τῇ</foreign> BH, and the literal translation would be <quote>`AL` (or `BG`) <em>remaining</em>,</quote> but the shade of meaning conveyed by the position of the definite article can hardly be expressed in English.
