In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

===

Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` greater than the angle `BCA`;

I say that the side `AC` is also greater than the side `AB`.

For, if not, `AC` is either equal to `AB` or less.

Now `AC` is not equal to `AB`; for then the angle `ABC` would also have been equal to the angle `ACB`; [I.5] but it is not; 

- therefore `AC` is not equal to `AB`.

Neither is `AC` less than `AB`, for then the angle `ABC` would also have been less than the angle `ACB`; [I.18] but it is not; 

- therefore `AC` is not less than `AB`.

And it was proved that it is not equal either. 

- Therefore `AC` is greater than `AB`.

Therefore etc.

- Q. E. D.
