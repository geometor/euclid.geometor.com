In right-angled triangles the square on [^1] the side subtending the right angle [^2] is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.

===

Let `ABC` be a right-angled triangle having the angle `BAC` right;

I say that the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`.

For let there be described on `BC` the square `BDEC`, and on `BA`, `AC` the squares `GB`, `HC`; [1.46] through `A` let `AL` be drawn parallel to either `BD` or `CE`, and let `AD`, `FC` be joined.

Then, since each of the angles `BAC`, `BAG` is right, it follows that with a straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, the two straight lines `AC`, `AG` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; 

- therefore `CA` is in a straight line with `AG`. [1.14]

For the same reason 

- `BA` is also in a straight line with `AH`.

And, since the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `FBA`: for each is right: let the angle `ABC` be added to each; 

- therefore the whole angle `DBA` is equal to the whole angle `FBC`. [1.c.n.2]

And, since `DB` is equal to `BC`, and `FB` to `BA`, the two sides `AB`, `BD` are equal to the two sides `FB`, `BC` respectively, [^3]

- and the angle `ABD` is equal to the angle `FBC`; therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `ABD` is equal to the triangle `FBC`. [1.4]

Now the parallelogram `BL` is double of the triangle `ABD`, for they have the same base `BD` and are in the same parallels `BD`, `AL`. [1.41]

And the square `GB` is double of the triangle `FBC`, for they again have the same base `FB` and are in the same parallels `FB`, `GC`. [1.41]

[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.] [^4]

- Therefore the parallelogram `BL` is also equal to the square `GB`.

Similarly, if `AE`, `BK` be joined, the parallelogram `CL` can also be proved equal to the square `HC`; 

- therefore the whole square `BDEC` is equal to the two squares `GB`, `HC`. [1.c.n.2]

And the square `BDEC` is described on `BC`, 

- and the squares `GB`, `HC` on `BA`, `AC`.

Therefore the square on the side `BC` is equal to the squares on the sides `BA`, `AC`.

Therefore etc.
