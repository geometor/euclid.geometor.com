If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.

===

Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` equal to the angle `ACB`; 

I say that the side `AB` is also equal to the side `AC`.

For, if `AB` is unequal to `AC`, one of them is greater.

Let `AB` be greater; and from `AB` the greater let `DB` be cut off equal to `AC` the less;

let `DC` be joined. 

Then, since `DB` is equal to `AC`, and `BC` is common, 

- the two sides `DB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `AC`, `CB` respectively;

and the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `ACB`; 

- therefore the base `DC` is equal to the base `AB`, and the triangle `DBC` will be equal to the triangle `ACB`, the less to the greater: which is absurd. Therefore `AB` is not unequal to `AC`; it is therefore equal to it.

Therefore etc.

- Q. E. D.
