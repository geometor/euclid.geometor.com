If two triangles have the two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the side adjoining the equal angles, [^I.26:1] or that subtending one of the equal angles, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides and the remaining angle to the remaining angle. 

===

Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two angles `ABC`, `BCA` equal to the two angles `DEF`, `EFD` respectively, namely the angle `ABC` to the angle `DEF`, and the angle `BCA` to the angle `EFD`; and let them also have one side equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely `BC` to `EF`;

I say that they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, namely `AB` to `DE` and `AC` to `DF`, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle, namely the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`.

For, if `AB` is unequal to `DE`, one of them is greater.

Let `AB` be greater, and let `BG` be made equal to `DE`; and let `GC` be joined. 

Then, since `BG` is equal to `DE`, and `BC` to `EF`, the two sides `GB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively; and the angle `GBC` is equal to the angle `DEF`;

- therefore the base `GC` is equal to the base `DF`, and the triangle `GBC` is equal to the triangle `DEF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I.4] therefore the angle `GCB` is equal to the angle `DFE`.

But the angle `DFE` is by hypothesis equal to the angle `BCA`; [^I.26:2]

- therefore the angle `BCG` is equal to the angle `BCA`, the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore `AB` is not unequal to `DE`, and is therefore equal to it.

But `BC` is also equal to `EF`; 

- therefore the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `DEF`; therefore the base `AC` is equal to the base `DF`, and the remaining angle `BAC` is equal to the remaining angle `EDF`. [I.4]

Again, let sides subtending equal angles be equal, as `AB` to `DE`;

I say again that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides, namely `AC` to `DF` and `BC` to `EF`, and further the remaining angle `BAC` is equal to the remaining angle `EDF`.

For, if `BC` is unequal to `EF`, one of them is greater.

Let `BC` be greater, if possible, and let `BH` be made equal to `EF`; let `AH` be joined. 

Then, since `BH` is equal to `EF`, and `AB` to `DE`, the two sides `AB`, `BH` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and they contain equal angles;

- therefore the base `AH` is equal to the base `DF`,

and the triangle `ABH` is equal to the triangle `DEF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I.4]

- therefore the angle `BHA` is equal to the angle `EFD`.

But the angle `EFD` is equal to the angle `BCA`; therefore, in the triangle `AHC`, the exterior angle `BHA` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `BCA`:

- which is impossible. [I.16]

Therefore `BC` is not unequal to `EF`,

- and is therefore equal to it.

But `AB` is also equal to `DE`; therefore the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and they contain equal angles;

- therefore the base `AC` is equal to the base `DF`, the triangle `ABC` equal to the triangle `DEF`,

and the remaining angle `BAC` equal to the remaining angle `EDF`. [I.4]

Therefore etc.
