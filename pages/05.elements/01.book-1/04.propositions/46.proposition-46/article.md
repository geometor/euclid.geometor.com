On a given straight line to describe a square.

===

Let `AB` be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line `AB`. [^1]

Let `AC` be drawn at right angles to the straight line `AB` from the point `A` on it [1.11], and let `AD` be made equal to `AB`; through the point `D` let `DE` be drawn parallel to `AB`, and through the point `B` let `BE` be drawn parallel to `AD`. [1.31] <pb n="348"/>

Therefore `ADEB` is a parallelogram; 

- therefore `AB` is equal to `DE`, and `AD` to `BE`. [1.34]

But `AB` is equal to `AD`; 

- therefore the four straight lines `BA`, `AD`, `DE`, `EB` are equal to one another;

therefore the parallelogram `ADEB` is equilateral.

I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since the straight line `AD` falls upon the parallels `AB`, `DE`, 

- the angles `BAD`, `ADE` are equal to two right angles. [1.29]

But the angle `BAD` is right; 

- therefore the angle `ADE` is also right.

And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another; [1.34] 

- therefore each of the opposite angles `ABE`, `BED` is also right. Therefore `ADEB` is right-angled.

And it was also proved equilateral. 

Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line `AB`.
