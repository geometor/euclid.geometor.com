<p><emph>To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of the remaining one</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of the remaining one</em>. </p>

<p>Let any straight line <em>AB</em> be set out, and let it be cut at the point <em>C</em> so that the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the square on <em>CA</em>; [<a href="/elem.2.11">II. 11</a>] with centre <em>A</em> and distance <em>AB</em> let the circle <em>BDE</em> be described, and let there be fitted in the circle <em>BDE</em> the straight line <em>BD</em> equal to the straight line <em>AC</em> which is not greater than the diameter of the circle <em>BDE</em>. [<a href="/elem.4.1">IV. 1</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em> be joined, and let the circle <em>ACD</em> be circumscribed about the triangle <em>ACD</em>. [<a href="/elem.4.5">IV. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the square on <em>AC</em>, and <em>AC</em> is equal to <em>BD</em>, therefore the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the square on <em>BD</em>. </p>

<p>And, since a point <em>B</em> has been taken outside the circle <em>ACD</em>, and from <em>B</em> the two straight lines <em>BA</em>, <em>BD</em> have fallen on the circle <em>ACD</em>, and one of them cuts it, while the other falls on it, and the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> is equal to the square on <em>BD</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>BD</em> touches the circle <em>ACD</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.37">III. 37</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Since, then, <em>BD</em> touches it, and <em>DC</em> is drawn across from the point of contact at <em>D</em>, therefore the angle <em>BDC</em> is equal to the angle <em>DAC</em> in the alternate segment of the circle. [<a href="/elem.3.32">III. 32</a>] </p>

<p>Since, then, the angle <em>BDC</em> is equal to the angle <em>DAC</em>, let the angle <em>CDA</em> be added to each; therefore the whole angle <em>BDA</em> is equal to the two angles <em>CDA</em>, <em>DAC</em>. <pb n="97"/></p>

<p>But the exterior angle <em>BCD</em> is equal to the angles <em>CDA</em>, <em>DAC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the angle <em>BDA</em> is also equal to the angle <em>BCD</em>. </p>

<p>But the angle <em>BDA</em> is equal to the angle <em>CBD</em>, since the side <em>AD</em> is also equal to <em>AB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] so that the angle <em>DBA</em> is also equal to the angle <em>BCD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the three angles <em>BDA</em>, <em>DBA</em>, <em>BCD</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>And, since the angle <em>DBC</em> is equal to the angle <em>BCD</em>, <span class="center">the side <em>BD</em> is also equal to the side <em>DC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>BD</em> is by hypothesis equal to <em>CA</em>; therefore <em>CA</em> is also equal to <em>CD</em>, <span class="center">so that the angle <em>CDA</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DAC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span> therefore the angles <em>CDA</em>, <em>DAC</em> are double of the angle <em>DAC</em>. </p>

<p>But the angle <em>BCD</em> is equal to the angles <em>CDA</em>, <em>DAC</em>; therefore the angle <em>BCD</em> is also double of the angle <em>CAD</em>. </p>

<p>But the angle <em>BCD</em> is equal to each of the angles <em>BDA</em>, <em>DBA</em>; therefore each of the angles <em>BDA</em>, <em>DBA</em> is also double of the angle <em>DAB</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the isosceles triangle <em>ABD</em> has been constructed having each of the angles at the base <em>DB</em> double of the remaining one. Q. E. F.</p>
