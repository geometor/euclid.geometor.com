<p><emph>Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given circle, and <em>D</em> the given straight line not greater than the diameter of the circle; thus it is required to fit into the circle <em>ABC</em> a straight line equal to the straight line <em>D</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let a diameter <em>BC</em> of the circle <em>ABC</em> be drawn. </p>

<p>Then, if <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>D</em>, that which was enjoined will have been done; for <em>BC</em> has been fitted into the circle <em>ABC</em> equal to the straight line <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>But, if <em>BC</em> is greater than <em>D</em>, let <em>CE</em> be made equal to <em>D</em>, and with centre <em>C</em> and distance <em>CE</em> let the circle <em>EAF</em> be described; let <em>CA</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since the point <em>C</em> is the centre of the circle <em>EAF</em>, <span class="center"><em>CA</em> is equal to <em>CE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>CE</em> is equal to <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>D</em> is also equal to <em>CA</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore into the given circle <em>ABC</em> there has been fitted <em>CA</em> equal to the given straight line <em>D</em>.</p>
