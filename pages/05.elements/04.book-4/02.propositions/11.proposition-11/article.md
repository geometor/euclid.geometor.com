<p><emph>In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCDE</em> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle <em>ABCDE</em> an equilateral and equiangular pentagon. </p>

<p>Let the isosceles triangle <em>FGH</em> be set out having each of the angles at <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> double of the angle at <em>F</em>; [<a href="/elem.4.10">IV. 10</a>]  let there be inscribed in the circle <em>ABCDE</em> the triangle <em>ACD</em> equiangular with the triangle <em>FGH</em>, so that the angle <em>CAD</em> is equal to the angle at <em>F</em> and the angles at <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> respectively equal to the angles <em>ACD</em>, <em>CDA</em>; [<a href="/elem.4.2">IV. 2</a>] therefore each of the angles <em>ACD</em>, <em>CDA</em> is also double of the angle <em>CAD</em>. </p>

<p>Now let the angles <em>ACD</em>, <em>CDA</em> be bisected respectively by the straight lines <em>CE</em>, <em>DB</em> [<a href="/elem.1.9">I. 9</a>], and let <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>EA</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since each of the angles <em>ACD</em>, <em>CDA</em> is double of the angle <em>CAD</em>, and they have been bisected by the straight lines <em>CE</em>, <em>DB</em>, <pb n="101"/>therefore the five angles <em>DAC</em>, <em>ACE</em>, <em>ECD</em>, <em>CDB</em>, <em>BDA</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<a href="/elem.3.26">III. 26</a>] therefore the five circumferences <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>EA</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>But equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<a href="/elem.3.29">III. 29</a>] therefore the five straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>EA</em> are equal to one another; <span class="center">therefore the pentagon <em>ABCDE</em> is equilateral.</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>

<p>For, since the circumference <em>AB</em> is equal to the circumference <em>DE</em>, let <em>BCD</em> be added to each; <span class="center">therefore the whole circumference <em>ABCD</em> is equal to the whole circumference <em>EDCB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And the angle <em>AED</em> stands on the circumference <em>ABCD</em>, and the angle <em>BAE</em> on the circumference <em>EDCB</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>AED</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.27">III. 27</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason each of the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BCD</em>, <em>CDE</em> is also equal to each of the angles <em>BAE</em>, <em>AED</em>; <span class="center">therefore the pentagon <em>ABCDE</em> is equiangular.</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was also proved equilateral; <span class="center">therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F.</span></p>
