<p><hi rend="ital">Incommensurable magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">Incommensurable magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be incommensurable magnitudes; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> has not to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number, <span class="ital">A</span> will be commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But it is not; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has not to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. 
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
