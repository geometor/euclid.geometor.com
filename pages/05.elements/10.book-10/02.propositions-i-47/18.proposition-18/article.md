<p>
       <span class="ital">If there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divde it into parts which are incommensurable, the square on the greater will be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater.</span>
      </p>

<p><span class="ital">And, if the square on the greater be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater, and if there be applied to the greater a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, it divdes it into parts which are incommensurable</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be two unequal straight lines, of which <span class="ital">BC</span> is the greater, and to <span class="ital">BC</span> let there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, <span class="ital">A</span>, and deficient by a square figure. Let this be the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>, [cf. <a href="/elem.10.16.l.1">Lemma before X. 17</a>]  and let <span class="ital">BD</span> be incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>; I say that the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction as before, we can prove similarly that the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>It is to be proved that <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DF</span>. <pb n="46"/></p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">BD</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DC</span> is commensurable with the sum of <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also incommensurable with the sum of <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is also incommensurable in length with the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on <span class="ital">FD</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Again, let the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> be greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>, and let there be applied to <span class="ital">BC</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">A</span> and deficient by a square figure. Let this be the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>It is to be proved that <span class="ital">BD</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FD</span>. so that <span class="ital">BC</span> is also incommensurable with the remainder, the sum of <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the sum of <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] so that, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.

<div id="elem.10.18.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>[Since it has been proved that straight lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in square also, while those commensurable in square are not always commensurable in length also, but can of course be either commensurable or incommensurable in length, it is manifest that, if any straight line be commensurable in length with a given rational straight line, it is called rational and commensurable with the other not only in length but in square also, since straight lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in square also. </p>

       
<p>But, if any straight line be commensurable in square with a given rational straight line, then, if it is also commensurable in length with it, it is called in this case also rational and commensurable with it both in length and in square; but, if again any straight line, being commensurable in square with a given rational straight line, be incommensurable in length with it, it is called in this case also rational but commensurable in square only.]</p>
