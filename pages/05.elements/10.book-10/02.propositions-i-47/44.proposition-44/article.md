<p><hi rend="ital">A second bimedial straight line is divided at one point only</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A second bimedial straight line is divded at one point only</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a second bimedial straight line divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle; [<a href="/elem.10.38">X. 38</a>
] it is then manifest that <span class="ital">C</span> is not at the point of bisection, because the segments are not commensurable in length. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not so divded at another point. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be divded at <span class="ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">DB</span>, but <span class="ital">AC</span> is supposed greater; it is then clear that the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also, as we proved above [Lemma], less than the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; and suppose that <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle. </p>

<p>Now let a rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out, let there be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span> the rectangular parallelogram <span class="ital">EK</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">EG</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be subtracted; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>Again, let there be subtracted <span class="ital">EL</span>, equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, which were proved less than the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> [<a href="/elem.10.41.l.1">Lemma</a>
]; <pb n="96"/>therefore the remainder <span class="ital">MK</span> is also equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial, therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>
] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">HN</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AC</span> is to <span class="ital">CB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>; for <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are commensurable in square. [<a href="/elem.10.15">x. 15</a>
] </p>

<p>And twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are also incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>
] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EG</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, and <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">HK</span>, so that <span class="ital">EH</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">HN</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>
, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] </p>

<p>And they are rational; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HN</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>

<p>But, if two rational straight lines commensurable in square only be added together, the whole is the irrational which is called binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EN</span> is a binomial straight line divded at <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>In the same way <span class="ital">EM</span>, <span class="ital">MN</span> will also be proved to be rational straight lines commensurable in square only; and <span class="ital">EN</span> will be a binomial straight line divded at different points, <span class="ital">H</span> and <span class="ital">M</span>. <pb n="97"/></p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EH</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">MN</span>. </p>

<p>For the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are greater than the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>; therefore also the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, that is, <span class="ital">EG</span>, are much greater than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MK</span>, so that <span class="ital">EH</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">MN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is not the same with <span class="ital">MN</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
