<p><hi rend="ital">To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a medial rectangle</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a medial rectangle</span>. </p>

<p>Let the rational straight lines <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> commensurable in square only be set out; let <span class="ital">D</span> be taken a mean proportional between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.13">VI. 13</a>] and let it be contrived that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>]</span>
       
      </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">D</span> [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>], is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] <pb n="62"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And since <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are commensurable in square only, and, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23">X. 23</a>, addition] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>

<p>I say next that they also contain a medial rectangle. </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore, alternately, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.16">VI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is medial; [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square only have been found which contain a medial rectangle. Q. E. D.

<p><span class="ital">To find two square numbers such that their sum is also square</span>. </p>

       
<p>Let two numbers <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be set out, and let them be either both even or both odd. 
       </p>

       
<p>Then since, whether an even number is subtracted from an even number, or an odd number from an odd number, the remainder is even, [<a href="/elem.9.24 elem.9.26">IX. 24, 26</a>] therefore the remainder <span class="ital">AC</span> is even. </p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">AC</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> also be either similar plane numbers, or square numbers, which are themselves also similar plane numbers. </p>

       
<p>Now the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>] </p>

       
<p>And the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is square, inasmuch as it was proved that, if two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another make some number the product is square. [<a href="/elem.9.1">IX. 1</a>] </p>

       
<p>Therefore two square numbers, the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>, have been found which, when added together, make the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

       
<p>And it is manifest that two square numbers, the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> and the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>, have again been found such that their difference, the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, is a square, whenever <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are similar plane numbers. </p>

       
<p>But when they are not similar plane numbers, two square numbers, the square on <span class="ital">BD</span> and the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, have been found such that their difference, the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, is not square. Q. E. D.</p>

<p><span class="ital">To find two square numbers such that their sum is not square</span>. </p>

       
<p>For let the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, as we said, be square, and <span class="ital">CA</span> even, and let <span class="ital">CA</span> be bisected by <span class="ital">D</span>. 
       </p>

       
<p>It is then manifest that the square product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. [See <a href="/elem.10.28.l.1">Lemma 1</a>] </p>

       
<p>Let the unit <span class="ital">DE</span> be subtracted; therefore the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is less than the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

       
<p>I say then that the square product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> will not be square. </p>

       
<p>For, if it is square, it is either equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>, or less than the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>, but cannot any more be greater, lest the unit be divded. </p>

       
<p>First, if possible, let the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>, and let <span class="ital">GA</span> be double of the unit <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

       
<p>Since then the whole <span class="ital">AC</span> is double of the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>, and in them <span class="ital">AG</span> is double of <span class="ital">DE</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">GC</span> is also double of the remainder <span class="ital">EC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">GC</span> is bisected by <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">GB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>] </p>

       
<p>But the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is also, by hypothesis, equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>; <pb n="65"/>therefore the product of <span class="ital">GB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span>. </p>

       
<p>And, if the common square on <span class="ital">CE</span> be subtracted, it follows that <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">GB</span>: which is absurd. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is not equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

       
<p>I say next that neither is it less than the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

       
<p>For, if possible, let it be equal to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>, and let <span class="ital">HA</span> be double of <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

       
<p>Now it will again follow that <span class="ital">HC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CF</span>; so that <span class="ital">CH</span> has also been bisected at <span class="ital">F</span>, and for this reason the product of <span class="ital">HB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">FC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.6">II. 6</a>] </p>

       
<p>But, by hypothesis, the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>. </p>

       
<p>Thus the product of <span class="ital">HB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> will also be equal to the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span>: which is absurd. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is not less than the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

       
<p>And it was proved that neither is it equal to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CE</span> is not square. Q. E. D.</p>
