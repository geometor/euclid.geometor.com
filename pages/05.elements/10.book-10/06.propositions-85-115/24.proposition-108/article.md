<p><span class="ital">If from a rational area a medial area be subtracted, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the remaining area becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight line</span>. </p>

<p>For from the rational area <span class="ital">BC</span> let the medial area <span class="ital">BD</span> be subtracted; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the remainder <span class="ital">EC</span> becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight line. 
      </p>

<p>For let a rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> be set out, to <span class="ital">FG</span> let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram <span class="ital">GH</span> equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, and let <span class="ital">GK</span> equal to <span class="ital">DB</span> be subtracted; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">EC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LH</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational, and <span class="ital">BD</span> medial, while <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">GH</span>, and <span class="ital">BD</span> to <span class="ital">GK</span>, therefore <span class="ital">GH</span> is rational, and <span class="ital">GK</span> medial. </p>

<p>And they are applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] while <span class="ital">FK</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FH</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is an apotome [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>], and <span class="ital">KF</span> the annex to it. </p>

<p>Now the square on <span class="ital">HF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> by the square on a straight line either commensurable with <span class="ital">HF</span> or not commensurable. </p>

<p>First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with it. </p>

<p>Now the whole <span class="ital">HF</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is a first apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.1">X. Deff. III. 1</a>] <pb n="236"/></p>

<p>But the <quote>side</quote>
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a first apotome is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.91">X. 91</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">LH</span>, that is, of <span class="ital">EC</span>, is an apotome. </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">HF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">HF</span>, while the whole <span class="ital">FH</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> set out, <span class="ital">KH</span> is a fourth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.4">X. Deff. III. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But the <quote>side</quote>
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a fourth apotome is minor. [<a href="/elem.10.94">X. 94</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
