<p><hi rend="ital">If from a medial area there be subtracted a medial area incommensurable with the whole, the two remaining irrational straight lines arise, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole</hi>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">If from a medial area there be subtracted a medial area incommensurable with the whole, the two remaining irrational straight lines arise, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole</span>. </p>

<p>For, as in the foregoing figures, let there be subtracted from the medial area <span class="ital">BC</span> the medial area <span class="ital">BD</span> incommensurable with the whole;  I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">EC</span> is one of two irrational straight lines, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. <pb n="239"/></p>

<p>For, since each of the rectangles <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is medial, and <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">BD</span>, it follows that each of the straight lines <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> will be rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">BD</span>, that is, <span class="ital">GH</span> with <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>If then the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">FH</span>, while neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> set out, <span class="ital">KH</span> is a third apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.3">X. Deff. III. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KL</span> is rational, and the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a third apotome is irrational, and the <quote>side</quote>
 of it is irrational, and is called a second apotome of a medial straight line; [<a href="/elem.10.93">X. 93</a>] so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">LH</span>, that is, of <span class="ital">EC</span>, is a second apotome of a medial straight line. </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">FH</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">FH</span>, while neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">HF</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span> is a sixth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.6">X. Deff. III. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But the <quote>side</quote>
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a sixth apotome is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. [<a href="/elem.10.96">X. 96</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">LH</span>, that is, of <span class="ital">EC</span>, is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. Q. E. D.</p>
