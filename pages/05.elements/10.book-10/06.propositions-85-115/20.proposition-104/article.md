<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable with an apotome of a medial straight line is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable with an apotome of a medial straight line is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be an apotome of a medial straight line, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is an apotome of a medial straight line, let <span class="ital">EB</span> be the annex to it. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.74 elem.10.75">X. 74, 75</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">BE</span> to <span class="ital">DF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>, and <span class="ital">BE</span> with <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also medial straight lines [<a href="/elem.10.23">X. 23</a>] commensurable in square only; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is an apotome of a medial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.74 elem.10.75">X. 74, 75</a>] <pb n="232"/></p>

<p>I say next that it is also the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Since, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>, therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CF</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is also commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, if the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is rational, the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> will also be rational, [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] and if the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is medial, the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.74 elem.10.75">X. 74, 75</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
