<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with an apotome is an apotome and the same in order</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with an apotome is an apotome and the same in order</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be an apotome, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>;  I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also an apotome and the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. <pb n="230"/></p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is an apotome, let <span class="ital">BE</span> be the annex to it; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that the ratio of <span class="ital">BE</span> to <span class="ital">DF</span> is the same as the ratio of <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">CD</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>] therefore also, as one is to one, so are all to all; [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>] therefore also, as the whole <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the whole <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>, and <span class="ital">BE</span> with <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">BE</span> to <span class="ital">DF</span>, alternately therefore, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EB</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>

<p>If then the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EB</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> will also be greater than the square on <span class="ital">FD</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, <span class="ital">CF</span> is so also, [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] if <span class="ital">BE</span>, then <span class="ital">DF</span> also, [id.] and, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, then neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EB</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> will also be greater than the square on <span class="ital">FD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] <pb n="231"/></p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, <span class="ital">CF</span> is so also, if <span class="ital">BE</span>, then <span class="ital">DF</span> also, [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] and, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, then neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is an apotome and the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
