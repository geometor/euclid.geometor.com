<p><hi rend="ital">To find the second apotome</hi>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">To find the second apotome</span>. </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> be set out, and <span class="ital">GC</span> commensurable in length with <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore <span class="ital">GC</span> is rational. 
      </p>

<p>Let two square numbers <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out, and let their difference <span class="ital">DF</span> not be square. </p>

<p>Now let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">FD</span> is to <span class="ital">DE</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CG</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">CG</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">CG</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">GB</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="ital">BG</span> is rational. </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">GC</span> has not to the square on <span class="ital">GB</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, <span class="ital">CG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">CG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a second apotome. </p>

<p>For let the square on <span class="ital">H</span> be that by which the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GC</span>. </p>

<p>Since then, as the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">GC</span>, so is the number <span class="ital">ED</span> to the number <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">DE</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And each of the numbers <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> is square; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">BG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">H</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GC</span> by the square on <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GC</span>
       <pb n="181"/>by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BG</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CG</span>, the annex, is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="ital">A</span> set out. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is a second apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.2">X. Deff. III. 2</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the second apotome <span class="ital">BC</span> has been found. Q. E. D.</p>
