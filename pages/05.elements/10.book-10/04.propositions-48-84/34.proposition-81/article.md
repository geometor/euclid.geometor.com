<p><hi rend="ital">To a second apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">To a second apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a second apotome of a medial straight line and <span class="ital">BC</span> an annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> which they contain is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.75">X. 75</a>] 
      </p>

<p>I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to <span class="ital">AB</span> which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">BD</span> also be so annexed; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> which they contain is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.75">X. 75</a>] </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span> be set out, let <span class="ital">EG</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EM</span> as breadth, and let <span class="ital">HG</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> be subtracted, producing <span class="ital">HM</span> as breadth; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">EL</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] so that <span class="ital">AB</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">EL</span>. </p>

<p>Again, let <span class="ital">EI</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> be applied to <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EN</span> as breadth. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EL</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">HI</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are also medial. <pb n="171"/></p>

<p>And they are equal to <span class="ital">EG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 15 and 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">EM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">EM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is medial, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And it is equal to <span class="ital">HG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">HG</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="ital">HM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">HM</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AC</span> is to <span class="ital">CB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EG</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, while <span class="ital">GH</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">HG</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">EG</span> is to <span class="ital">HG</span>, so is <span class="ital">EM</span> to <span class="ital">HM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">EM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">EM</span>, <span class="ital">MH</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is an apotome, and <span class="ital">HM</span> an annex to it. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] <pb n="172"/></p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">HN</span> is also an annex to it; therefore to an apotome different straight lines are annexed which are commensurable with the wholes in square only: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.10.79">X. 79</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
