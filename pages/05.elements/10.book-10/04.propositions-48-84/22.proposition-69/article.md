<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable with the side of a rational plus a medial area is itself also the side of a rational plus a medial area</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable with the side of a rational plus a medial area is itself also the side of a rational plus a medial area</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the side of a rational plus a medial area, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; it is to be proved that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also the side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be divded into its straight lines at <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [<a href="/elem.10.40">X. 40</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before. </p>

<p>We can then prove similarly that <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are incommensurable in square, and the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>; so that the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also medial, and the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> rational. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area. Q. E. D.</p>
