<p><hi rend="ital">The square on the second bimedial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the third binomial</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The square on the second bimedial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the third binomial</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a second bimedial straight line divded into its medials at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is the greater segment; let <span class="ital">DE</span> be any rational straight line, and to <span class="ital">DE</span> let there be applied the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as its breadth;  I say that <span class="ital">DG</span> is a third binomial straight line. </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before shown. <pb n="138"/></p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is a second bimedial divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle, [<a href="/elem.10.38">X. 38</a>] so that the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 15 and 23 Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And it is equal to <span class="ital">DL</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MD</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason, <span class="ital">MG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">ML</span>, that is, with <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CB</span>, and, as <span class="ital">AC</span> is to <span class="ital">CB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is also incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Hence the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.12 elem.10.13">X. 12, 13</a>] that is, <span class="ital">DL</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">MF</span>, so that <span class="ital">DM</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">MG</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And they are rational; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>It is to be proved that it is also a third binomial straight line. </p>

<p>In manner similar to the foregoing we may conclude that <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than <span class="ital">MG</span>, and that <span class="ital">DK</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. </p>

<p>And the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">DM</span>. </p>

<p>And neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is a third binomial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.3">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] Q. E. D.<pb n="139"/></p>
