<p><hi rend="ital">The square on the major straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fourth binomial</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The square on the major straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fourth binomial</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a major straight line divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CB</span>; let <span class="ital">DE</span> be a rational straight line, <pb n="140"/>and to <span class="ital">DE</span> let there be applied the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="ital">DG</span> is a fourth binomial straight line. 
      </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before shown. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is a major straight line divded at <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [<a href="/elem.10.39">X. 39</a>] </p>

<p>Since then the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is rational, therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MF</span>, is medial, and it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">ML</span>, therefore <span class="ital">MG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>It is to be proved that it is also a fourth binomial straight line. </p>

<p>In manner similar to the foregoing we can prove that <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than <span class="ital">MG</span>, and that the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>. </p>

<p>Since then the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>, so that <span class="ital">DK</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divde it into incommensurable parts, then the <pb n="141"/>square on the greater will be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with the greater; [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">DM</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and <span class="ital">DM</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> set out. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is a fourth binomial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.4">X. Deff. II. 4</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
