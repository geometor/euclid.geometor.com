<p><hi rend="ital">The square on the binomial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the first binomial</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The square on the binomial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the first binomial</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a binomial straight line divded into its terms at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is the greater term; let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> be set out, and let <span class="ital">DEFG</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span> producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="ital">DG</span> is a first binomial straight line. 
      </p>

<p>For let there be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span> the rectangle <span class="ital">DH</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, and <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, is equal to <span class="ital">MF</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">MG</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">NO</span> be drawn parallel [to <span class="ital">ML</span> or <span class="ital">GF</span>]. </p>

<p>Therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">MO</span>, <span class="ital">NF</span> is equal to once the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is a binomial divded into its terms at <span class="ital">C</span>, <pb n="133"/>therefore <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are rational and commensurable with one another, so that the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is also rational. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>And it is equal to <span class="ital">DL</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is rational. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, that is <span class="ital">MF</span>, is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">ML</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">ML</span>, that is, <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">MD</span> is also rational and is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">MG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And they are rational; therefore <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>It is next to be proved that it is also a first binomial straight line. </p>

<p>Since the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is a mean proportional between the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, [cf. <a href="/elem.10.53.l.1">Lemma after X. 53</a>] therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is also a mean proportional between <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">DH</span> is to <span class="ital">MO</span>, so is <span class="ital">MO</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>, that is, as <span class="ital">DK</span> is to <span class="ital">MN</span>, so is <span class="ital">MN</span> to <span class="ital">MK</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">DH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>, so that <span class="ital">DK</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] <pb n="134"/></p>

<p>And, since the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.59.l.1">Lemma</a>] therefore <span class="ital">DL</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">MF</span>, so that <span class="ital">DM</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">MG</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>And the rectangle <span class="ital">DK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">MN</span>, that is, to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">MG</span>, and <span class="ital">DK</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. </p>

<p>But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divde it into commensurable parts, the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater; [<a href="/elem.10.17">X. 17</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">DM</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MG</span> are rational, and <span class="ital">DM</span>, which is the greater term, is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> set out. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is a first binomial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
