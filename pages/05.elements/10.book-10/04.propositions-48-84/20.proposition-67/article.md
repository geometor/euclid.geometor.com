<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with a bimedial straight line is itself also bimedial and the same in order</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with a bimedial straight line is itself also bimedial and the same in order</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be bimedial, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is bimedial and the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is bimedial, let it be divded into its medials at <span class="ital">E</span>; <pb n="148"/>therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.37 elem.10.38">X. 37, 38</a>] </p>

<p>And let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">EB</span> is to the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19">V. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are also commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> respectively. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are medial; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23">X. 23</a>] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>, [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] and <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are commensurable in square only, <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But they were also proved medial; therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is bimedial. </p>

<p>I say next that it is also the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>For since, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>, therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>; therefore, alternately, as the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CF</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is also commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>If therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is rational, the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also rational, [and for this reason <span class="ital">CD</span> is a first bimedial]; [<a href="/elem.10.37">X. 37</a>] but if medial, medial, [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> is a second bimedial. [<a href="/elem.10.38">X. 38</a>] </p>

<p>And for this reason <span class="ital">CD</span> will be the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
