<p>
       <span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">AC</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and the fifth binomial <span class="ital">AD</span> divded into its terms at <span class="ital">E</span>, so that <span class="ital">AE</span> is the greater term; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>

<p>For let the same construction be made as before shown; it is then manifest that <span class="ital">MO</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC.</span>
       
      </p>

<p>It is then to be proved that <span class="ital">MO</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">GE</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">HE</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] that is, the square on <span class="ital">MN</span> with the square on <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are incommensurable in square. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is a fifth binomial straight line, and <span class="ital">ED</span> the lesser segment, therefore <span class="ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.5">X. Deff. II. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">ED</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AE.</span> [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AK</span>, that is, the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">DE</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>, that is, with <span class="ital">EK</span>, while <span class="ital">DE</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">EK.</span> [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] <pb n="129"/></p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EK</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MR</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, is also rational. [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area [<a href="/elem.10.40">X. 40</a>] and is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC.</span> Q. E. D.</p>
