<p><hi rend="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line which is called binomial</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line which is called binomial</span>. </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">AC</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and the first binomial <span class="ital">AD</span>; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line which is called binomial. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is a first binomial straight line, let it be divded into its terms at <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">AE</span> be the greater term. <pb n="117"/></p>

<p>It is then manifest that <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, and <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> set out. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ED</span> be bisected at the point <span class="ital">F</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, therefore, if there be applied to the greater <span class="ital">AE</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, that is, to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>, and deficient by a square figure, it divdes it into commensurable parts. [<a href="/elem.10.17">X. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Let then the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> be applied to <span class="ital">AE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">EG</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">FL</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> parallel to either of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>; let the square <span class="ital">SN</span> be constructed equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">AH</span>, and the square <span class="ital">NQ</span> equal to <span class="ital">GK</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.14">II. 14</a>] and let them be placed so that <span class="ital">MN</span> is in a straight line with <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">RN</span> is also in a straight line with <span class="ital">NP</span>. </p>

<p>And let the parallelogram <span class="ital">SQ</span> be completed; therefore <span class="ital">SQ</span> is a square. [Lemma] </p>

<p>Now, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">AG</span> is to <span class="ital">EF</span>, so is <span class="ital">FE</span> to <span class="ital">EG</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] therefore also, as <span class="ital">AH</span> is to <span class="ital">EL</span>, so is <span class="ital">EL</span> to <span class="ital">KG</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">EL</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">SN</span>, and <span class="ital">GK</span> to <span class="ital">NQ</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EL</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span>. <pb n="118"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">MR</span> is also a mean proportional between the same <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span>; [Lemma] therefore <span class="ital">EL</span> is equal to <span class="ital">MR</span>, so that it is also equal to <span class="ital">PO</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> are also equal to <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span>; therefore the whole <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the whole <span class="ital">SQ</span>, that is, to the square on <span class="ital">MO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that <span class="ital">MO</span> is binomial. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">GE</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span> is also, by hypothesis, commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are also commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is rational; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> is also rational; therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> is rational, [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] and <span class="ital">AH</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">GK</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">SN</span>, and <span class="ital">GK</span> to <span class="ital">NQ</span>; therefore <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span>, that is, the squares on <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, are rational and commensurable. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">ED</span>, while <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">AG</span>, and <span class="ital">DE</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] so that <span class="ital">AH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">EL</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">SN</span>, and <span class="ital">EL</span> to <span class="ital">MR</span>; therefore <span class="ital">SN</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">MR</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">SN</span> is to <span class="ital">MR</span>, so is <span class="ital">PN</span> to <span class="ital">NR</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">PN</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">NR</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">PN</span> is equal to <span class="ital">MN</span>, and <span class="ital">NR</span> to <span class="ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="ital">MN</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>And the square on <span class="ital">MN</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">NO</span>, and each is rational; therefore <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. <pb n="119"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is binomial [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] and the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">AC</span>. Q. E. D.

 I use the word <quote>side</quote>
 in the sense explained in the blockquote on <a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a> (P. 13 above), i.e. as short for <quote>side of a square equal to.</quote>
