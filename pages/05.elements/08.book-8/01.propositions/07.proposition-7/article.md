===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the first measure the last, it will measure the second also.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, in continued proportion; and let <span class="ital">A</span> measure <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">A</span> does not measure <span class="ital">B</span>, neither will any other of the numbers measure any other. [<a href="/elem.8.6">VIII. 6</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
