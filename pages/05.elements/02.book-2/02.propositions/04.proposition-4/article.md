If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments.

===

For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at `C`; <lb n="5"/>I say that the square on `AB` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.

For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB`, [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] <lb n="10"/>let `BD` be joined; through `C` let `CF` be drawn parallel to either `AD` or `EB`, and through `G` let `HK` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `DE`. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] 
<lb n="15"/>

Then, since `CF` is parallel to `AD`, and `BD` has fallen on them, the exterior angle `CGB` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `ADB`. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]

But the angle `ADB` is equal to the angle `ABD`, <lb n="20"/><span class="center">since the side `BA` is also equal to `AD`; [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>]</span> therefore the angle `CGB` is also equal to the angle `GBC`, so that the side `BC` is also equal to the side `CG`. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>] <pb n="380"/>

But `CB` is equal to `GK`, and `CG` to `KB`; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] <span class="center">therefore `GK` is also equal to `KB`; <lb n="25"/>therefore `CGKB` is equilateral.</span>

I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since `CG` is parallel to `BK`, <span class="center">the angles `KBC`, `GCB` are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span>

But the angle `KBC` is right; <lb n="30"/><span class="center">therefore the angle `BCG` is also right, so that the opposite angles `CGK`, `GKB` are also right. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span>

Therefore `CGKB` is right-angled; and it was also proved equilateral; <span class="center">therefore it is a square; <lb n="35"/> and it is described on `CB`.</span>

For the same reason <span class="center">`HF` is also a square; and it is described on `HG`, that is `AC`. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>]</span>

Therefore the squares `HF`, `KC` are the squares on `AC`, `CB`. <lb n="40"/>

Now, since `AG` is equal to `GE`, and `AG` is the rectangle `AC`, `CB`, for `GC` is equal to `CB`, <span class="center">therefore `GE` is also equal to the rectangle `AC`, `CB`.</span>

Therefore `AG`, `GE` are equal to twice the rectangle `AC`, `CB`. <lb n="45"/>

But the squares `HF`, `CK` are also the squares on `AC`, `CB`; therefore the four areas `HF`, `CK`, `AG`, `GE` are equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.

But `HF`, `CK`, `AG`, `GE` are the whole `ADEB`, <lb n="50"/>which is the square on `AB`.

Therefore the square on `AB` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
