If a straight line be cut at random, the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment.

===

For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB` together with the square on `BC`. 

For let the square `CDEB` be described on `CB`; [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] let `ED` be drawn through to `F`, and through `A` let `AF` be drawn parallel to either `CD` or `BE`. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>]

Then `AE` is equal to `AD`, `CE`.

Now `AE` is the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC`, for it is contained by `AB`, `BE`, and `BE` is equal to `BC`;

`AD` is the rectangle `AC`, `CB`, for `DC` is equal to `CB`; <span class="center">and `DB` is the square on `CB`</span>. Therefore the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB` together with the square on `BC`.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
