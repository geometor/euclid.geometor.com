<p><span class="ital">If there be two equal plane angles</span>, <span class="ital">and on their vertices there be set up elevated straight lines containing equal angles with the original straight lines respectively</span>, <span class="ital">if on the elevated straight lines points be taken at random and perpendiculars be drawn from them to the planes in which the original angles are</span>, <span class="ital">and if from the points so arising in the planes straight lines be joined to the vertices of the original angles</span>, <span class="ital">they will contain</span>, <span class="ital">with the elevated straight lines</span>, <span class="ital">equal angles</span>. </p>

<p>Let the angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">EDF</span> be two equal rectilineal angles, and from the points <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> let the elevated straight lines <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">DM</span> be set up containing, with the original straight lines, equal angles respectively, namely, the angle <span class="ital">MDE</span> to the angle <span class="ital">GAB</span> and the angle <span class="ital">MDF</span> to the angle <span class="ital">GAC</span>, let points <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> be taken at random on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">DM</span>, let <span class="ital">GL</span>, <span class="ital">MN</span> be drawn from the points <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> perpendicular to the planes through <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> and <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, and let them meet the planes at <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">LA</span>, <span class="ital">ND</span> be joined; I say that the angle <span class="ital">GAL</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">MDN</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AH</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">DM</span>, and let <span class="ital">HK</span> be drawn through the point <span class="ital">H</span> parallel to <span class="ital">GL</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">GL</span> is perpendicular to the plane through <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is also perpendicular to the plane through. <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.8">XI. 8</a>] </p>

<p>From the points <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">N</span> let <span class="ital">KC</span>, <span class="ital">NF</span>, <span class="ital">KB</span>, <span class="ital">NE</span> be drawn perpendicular to the straight lines <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, and let <span class="ital">HC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span> be joined. <pb n="353"/></p>

<p>Since the square on <span class="ital">HA</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KA</span>, and the squares on <span class="ital">KC</span>, <span class="ital">CA</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">KA</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">HA</span> is also equal to the squares on <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KC</span>, <span class="ital">CA</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">HC</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KC</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">HA</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">HC</span>, <span class="ital">CA</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">HCA</span> is right. [<a href="/elem.1.48">I. 48</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">DFM</span> is also right. </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">ACH</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DFM</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">HAC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">MDF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MDF</span>, <span class="ital">HAC</span> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, that subtending one of the equal angles, that is, <span class="ital">HA</span> equal to <span class="ital">MD</span>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively. [<a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DF</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DF</span>, and <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">DE</span>, the two sides <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">FD</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">CAB</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">FDE</span>; therefore the base <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">EF</span>, the triangle to the triangle, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">ACB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DFE</span>. </p>

<p>But the right angle <span class="ital">ACK</span> is also equal to the right angle <span class="ital">DFN</span>; therefore the remaining angle <span class="ital">BCK</span> is also equal to the remaining angle <span class="ital">EFN</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">CBK</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">FEN</span>. <pb n="354"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BCK</span>, <span class="ital">EFN</span> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, that adjacent to the equal angles, that is, <span class="ital">BC</span> equal to <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [<a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FN</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AC</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">DF</span>; therefore the two sides <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CK</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FN</span>; and they contain right angles. </p>

<p>Therefore the base <span class="ital">AK</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">DN</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DM</span>, the square on <span class="ital">AH</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="ital">DM</span>. </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">AH</span>, for the angle <span class="ital">AKH</span> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] and the squares on <span class="ital">DN</span>, <span class="ital">NM</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">DM</span>, for the angle <span class="ital">DNM</span> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span> are equal to the squares on <span class="ital">DN</span>, <span class="ital">NM</span>; and of these the square on <span class="ital">AK</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">DN</span>; therefore the remaining square on <span class="ital">KH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">NM</span>; therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">MN</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">HA</span>, <span class="ital">AK</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">MD</span>, <span class="ital">DN</span> respectively, and the base <span class="ital">HK</span> was proved equal to the base <span class="ital">MN</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">HAK</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">MDN</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p>

<p>From this it is manifest that, if there be two equal plane angles, and if there be set up on them elevated straight lines which are equal and contain equal angles with the original straight lines respectively, the perpendiculars drawn from their extremities to the planes in which are the original angles are equal to one another.
