      </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two parallel planes be cut by any plane</span>, <span class="ital">their common sections are parallel.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two parallel planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be cut by the plane <span class="ital">EFGH</span>, and let <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> be their common sections; I say that <span class="ital">EF</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">GH</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if not, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> will, when produced, meet either in the direction of <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> or of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Let them be produced, as in the direction of <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, and let them, first, meet at <span class="ital">K</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">EFK</span> is in the plane <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore all the points on <span class="ital">EFK</span> are also in the plane <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.1">XI. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">K</span> is one of the points on the straight line <span class="ital">EFK</span>; therefore <span class="ital">K</span> is in the plane <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">K</span> is also in the plane <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore the planes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> will meet when produced. </p>

<p>But they do not meet, because they are, by hypothesis, parallel; therefore the straight lines <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> will not meet when produced in the direction of <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that neither will the straight lines <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span> meet when produced in the direction of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel. [<a href="/elem.1.def.23">I. Def. 23</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">GH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.<pb n="301"/></p>
