<p><span class="ital">If a parallelepipedal solid be cut by a plane which is parallel to the opposite planes</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>, <span class="ital">as the base is to the base</span>, <span class="ital">so will the solid be to the solid.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">ABCD</span> be cut by the plane <span class="ital">FG</span> which is parallel to the opposite planes <span class="ital">RA</span>, <span class="ital">DH</span>; I say that, as the base <span class="ital">AEFV</span> is to the base <span class="ital">EHCF</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">ABFU</span> to the solid <span class="ital">EGCD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">AH</span> be produced in each direction, let any number of straight lines whatever, <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, be made equal to <span class="ital">AE</span>, and any number whatever, <span class="ital">HM</span>, <span class="ital">MN</span>, equal to <span class="ital">EH</span>; and let the parallelograms <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">KV</span>, <span class="ital">HW</span>, <span class="ital">MS</span> and the solids <span class="ital">LQ</span>, <span class="ital">KR</span>, <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MT</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Then, since the straight lines <span class="ital">LK</span>, <span class="ital">KA</span>, <span class="ital">AE</span> are equal to one another, the parallelograms <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">KV</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span> are also equal to one another, <span class="ital">KO</span>, <span class="ital">KB</span>, <span class="ital">AG</span> are equal to one another, and further <span class="ital">LX</span>, <span class="ital">KQ</span>, <span class="ital">AR</span> are equal to one another, for they are opposite. [<a href="/elem.11.24">XI. 24</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason the parallelograms <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">HW</span>, <span class="ital">MS</span> are also equal to one another, <span class="ital">HG</span>, <span class="ital">HI</span>, <span class="ital">IN</span> are equal to one another, and further <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">MY</span>, <span class="ital">NT</span> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore in the solids <span class="ital">LQ</span>, <span class="ital">KR</span>, <span class="ital">AU</span> three planes are equal to three planes. <pb n="326"/></p>

<p>But the three planes are equal to the three opposite; therefore the three solids <span class="ital">LQ</span>, <span class="ital">KR</span>, <span class="ital">AU</span> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>For the same reason the three solids <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">DM</span>, <span class="ital">MT</span> are also equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <span class="ital">LF</span> is of the base <span class="ital">AF</span>, the same multiple also is the solid <span class="ital">LU</span> of the solid <span class="ital">AU</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason, whatever multiple the base <span class="ital">NF</span> is of the base <span class="ital">FH</span>, the same multiple also is the solid <span class="ital">NU</span> of the solid <span class="ital">HU</span>. </p>

<p>And, if the base <span class="ital">LF</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">NF</span>, the solid <span class="ital">LU</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">NU</span>; if the base <span class="ital">LF</span> exceeds the base <span class="ital">NF</span>, the solid <span class="ital">LU</span> also exceeds the solid <span class="ital">NU</span>; and, if one falls short, the other falls short. </p>

<p>Therefore, there being four magnitudes, the two bases <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span>, and the two solids <span class="ital">AU</span>, <span class="ital">UH</span>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <span class="ital">AF</span> and the solid <span class="ital">AU</span>, namely the base <span class="ital">LF</span> and the solid <span class="ital">LU</span>, and equimultiples of the base <span class="ital">HF</span> and the solid <span class="ital">HU</span>, namely the base <span class="ital">NF</span> and the solid <span class="ital">NU</span>, and it has been proved that, if the base <span class="ital">LF</span> exceeds the base <span class="ital">FN</span>, the solid <span class="ital">LU</span> also exceeds the solid <span class="ital">NU</span>, if the bases are equal, the solids are equal, and if the base falls short, the solid falls short. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the base <span class="ital">AF</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FH</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">AU</span> to the solid <span class="ital">UH</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
