<p><hi rend="ital">If a solid be contained by parallel planes</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If a solid be contained by parallel planes</span>, <span class="ital">the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the solid <span class="ital">CDHG</span> be contained by the parallel planes <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">GF</span>, <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">AE</span>; I say that the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic. 
      </p>

<p>For, since the two parallel planes <span class="ital">BG</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span> are cut by the plane <span class="ital">AC</span>, their common sections are parallel. [<a href="/elem.11.16">XI. 16</a>] <pb n="324"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>Again, since the two parallel planes <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">AE</span> are cut by the plane <span class="ital">AC</span>, their common sections are parallel. [<a href="/elem.11.16">XI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">AD</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> was also proved parallel to <span class="ital">DC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is a parallelogram. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that each of the planes <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, <span class="ital">BF</span>, <span class="ital">AE</span> is a parallelogram. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">DC</span>, and <span class="ital">BH</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>, the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BH</span> which meet one another are parallel to the two straight lines <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CF</span> which meet one another, not in the same plane; therefore they will contain equal angles; [<a href="/elem.11.10">XI. 10</a>] therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABH</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DCF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BH</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CF</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] and the angle <span class="ital">ABH</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DCF</span>, therefore the base <span class="ital">AH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">DF</span>, and the triangle <span class="ital">ABH</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="ital">DCF</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And the parallelogram <span class="ital">BG</span> is double of the triangle <span class="ital">ABH</span>, and the parallelogram <span class="ital">CE</span> double of the triangle <span class="ital">DCF</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">BG</span> is equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">CE</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <span class="ital">AC</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">GF</span>, and <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">BF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
