<p><span class="ital">To construct a solid angle out of three plane angles two of which</span>, <span class="ital">taken together in any manner</span>, <span class="ital">are greater than the remaining one: thus the three angles must be less than four right angles.</span>
       <pb n="315"/></p>

<p>Let the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> be the three given plane angles, and let two of these, taken together in any manner, be greater than the remaining one, while, further, the three are less than four right angles; thus it is required to construct a solid angle out of angles equal to the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> be cut off equal to one another, and let <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> be joined; it is therefore possible to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.22">XI. 22</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">LMN</span> be so constructed that <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> to <span class="ital">MN</span>, and further <span class="ital">GK</span> to <span class="ital">NL</span>, let the circle <span class="ital">LMN</span> be described about the triangle <span class="ital">LMN</span>, let its centre be taken, and let it be <span class="ital">O</span>; let <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">MO</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> be joined; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">LO</span>. </p>

<p>For, if not, <span class="ital">AB</span> is either equal to <span class="ital">LO</span>, or less. </p>

<p>First, let it be equal. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LO</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">OL</span> to <span class="ital">OM</span>, the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">OM</span> respectively; and, by hypothesis, the base <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">LM</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">LOM</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">MON</span>, and further the angle <span class="ital">GHK</span> to the angle <span class="ital">NOL</span>; <pb n="316"/>therefore the three angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> are equal to the three angles <span class="ital">LOM</span>, <span class="ital">MON</span>, <span class="ital">NOL</span>. </p>

<p>But the three angles <span class="ital">LOM</span>, <span class="ital">MON</span>, <span class="ital">NOL</span> are equal to four right angles; therefore the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> are equal to four right angles. </p>

<p>But they are also, by hypothesis, less than four right angles: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is not equal to <span class="ital">LO</span>. </p>

<p>I say next that neither is <span class="ital">AB</span> less than <span class="ital">LO</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be so, and let <span class="ital">OP</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and <span class="ital">OQ</span> equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, and let <span class="ital">PQ</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">OP</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">OQ</span>, so that the remainder <span class="ital">LP</span> is equal to <span class="ital">QM</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">LM</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">PQ</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] and <span class="ital">LMO</span> is equiangular with <span class="ital">PQO</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">OL</span> is to <span class="ital">LM</span>, so is <span class="ital">OP</span> to <span class="ital">PQ</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] and alternately, as <span class="ital">LO</span> is to <span class="ital">OP</span>, so is <span class="ital">LM</span> to <span class="ital">PQ</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">LO</span> is greater than <span class="ital">OP</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LM</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">PQ</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">LM</span> was made equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">PQ</span>. </p>

<p>Since, then, the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">PO</span>, <span class="ital">OQ</span>, and the base <span class="ital">AC</span> is greater than the base <span class="ital">PQ</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is greater than the angle <span class="ital">POQ</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.25">I. 25</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span> is also greater than the angle <span class="ital">MON</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">GHK</span> greater than the angle <span class="ital">NOL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the three angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> are greater than the three angles <span class="ital">LOM</span>, <span class="ital">MON</span>, <span class="ital">NOL</span>. </p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, the angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span> are less than four right angles; therefore the angles <span class="ital">LOM</span>, <span class="ital">MON</span>, <span class="ital">NOL</span> are much less than four right angles. <pb n="317"/></p>

<p>But they are also equal to four right angles: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is not less than <span class="ital">LO</span>. </p>

<p>And it was proved that neither is it equal; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">LO</span>. </p>

<p>Let then <span class="ital">OR</span> be set up from the point <span class="ital">O</span> at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">LMN</span>, [<a href="/elem.11.12">XI. 12</a>] and let the square on <span class="ital">OR</span> be equal to that area by which the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">LO</span>; [Lemma] let <span class="ital">RL</span>, <span class="ital">RM</span>, <span class="ital">RN</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">RO</span> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="ital">LMN</span>, therefore <span class="ital">RO</span> is also at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">MO</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">LO</span> is equal to <span class="ital">OM</span>, while <span class="ital">OR</span> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <span class="ital">RL</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">RM</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">RN</span> is also equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">RL</span>, <span class="ital">RM</span>; therefore the three straight lines <span class="ital">RL</span>, <span class="ital">RM</span>, <span class="ital">RN</span> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>Next, since by hypothesis the square on <span class="ital">OR</span> is equal to that area by which the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">LO</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">OR</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">LR</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">LO</span>, <span class="ital">OR</span>, for the angle <span class="ital">LOR</span> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">RL</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">RL</span>. </p>

<p>But each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, while each of the straight lines <span class="ital">RM</span>, <span class="ital">RN</span> is equal to <span class="ital">RL</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to each of the straight lines <span class="ital">RL</span>, <span class="ital">RM</span>, <span class="ital">RN</span>. <pb n="318"/></p>

<p>And, since the two sides <span class="ital">LR</span>, <span class="ital">RM</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and the base <span class="ital">LM</span> is by hypothesis equal to the base <span class="ital">AC</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">LRM</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason the angle <span class="ital">MRN</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">LRN</span> to the angle <span class="ital">GHK</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, out of the three plane angles <span class="ital">LRM</span>, <span class="ital">MRN</span>, <span class="ital">LRN</span>, which are equal to the three given angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHK</span>, the solid angle at <span class="ital">R</span> has been constructed, which is contained by the angles <span class="ital">LRM</span>, <span class="ital">MRN</span>, <span class="ital">LRN</span>.

<div id="elem.11.23.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>But how it is possible to take the square on <span class="ital">OR</span> equal to that area by which the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">LO</span>, we can show as follows. 
       </p>

       
<p>Let the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">LO</span> be set out, and let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the greater; let the semicircle <span class="ital">ABC</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and into the semicircle <span class="ital">ABC</span> let <span class="ital">AC</span> be fitted equal to the straight line <span class="ital">LO</span>, not being greater than the diameter <span class="ital">AB</span>; [<a href="/elem.4.1">IV. 1</a>] let <span class="ital">CB</span> be joined </p>

       
<p>Since then the angle <span class="ital">ACB</span> is an angle in the semicircle <span class="ital">ACB</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">ACB</span> is right. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] </p>

       
<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] </p>

       
<p>Hence the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> by the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

       
<p>But <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LO</span>. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">LO</span> by the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

       
<p>If then we cut off <span class="ital">OR</span> equal to <span class="ital">BC</span>, the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> will be greater than the square on <span class="ital">LO</span> by the square on <span class="ital">OR</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
