<p><span class="ital">If there be two prisms of equal height</span>, <span class="ital">and one have a parallelogram as base and the other a triangle</span>, <span class="ital">and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle</span>, <span class="ital">the prisms will be equal.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABCDEF</span>, <span class="ital">GHKLMN</span> be two prisms of equal height, let one have the parallelogram <span class="ital">AF</span> as base, and the other the triangle <span class="ital">GHK</span>, and let the parallelogram <span class="ital">AF</span> be double of the triangle <span class="ital">GHK</span>; I say that the prism <span class="ital">ABCDEF</span> is equal to the prism <span class="ital">GHKLMN</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the solids <span class="ital">AO</span>, <span class="ital">GP</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Since the parallelogram <span class="ital">AF</span> is double of the triangle <span class="ital">GHK</span>, while the parallelogram <span class="ital">HK</span> is also double of the triangle <span class="ital">GHK</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">AF</span> is equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">HK</span>. </p>

<p>But parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.11.31">XI. 31</a>] therefore the solid <span class="ital">AO</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">GP</span>. </p>

<p>And the prism <span class="ital">ABCDEF</span> is half of the solid <span class="ital">AO</span>, and the prism <span class="ital">GHKLMN</span> is half of the solid <span class="ital">GP</span>; [<a href="/elem.11.28">XI. 28</a>] therefore the prism <span class="ital">ABCDEF</span> is equal to the prism <span class="ital">GHKLMN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.<pb n="364"/></p>
