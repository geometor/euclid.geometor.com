<p>
       <span class="ital">On a given straight line to describe a parallelepipedal solid similar and similarly situated to a given parallelepipedal solid.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the given straight line and <span class="ital">CD</span> the given parallelepipedal solid; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> a parallelepipedal solid similar and similarly situated to the given parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For on the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and at the point <span class="ital">A</span> on it let the solid angle, contained by the angles <span class="ital">BAH</span>, <span class="ital">HAK</span>, <span class="ital">KAB</span>, be constructed equal to the solid angle at <span class="ital">C</span>, so that the angle <span class="ital">BAH</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">ECF</span>, the angle <span class="ital">BAK</span> equal to the angle <span class="ital">ECG</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">KAH</span> to the angle <span class="ital">GCF</span>; and let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">EC</span> is to <span class="ital">CG</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">AK</span>, and, as <span class="ital">GC</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">KA</span> to <span class="ital">AH</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">EC</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">AH</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Let the parallelogram <span class="ital">HB</span> and the solid <span class="ital">AL</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">EC</span> is to <span class="ital">CG</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">AK</span>, and the sides about the equal angles <span class="ital">ECG</span>, <span class="ital">BAK</span> are thus proportional, <pb n="330"/>therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">GE</span> is similar to the parallelogram <span class="ital">KB</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason the parallelogram <span class="ital">KH</span> is also similar to the parallelogram <span class="ital">GF</span>, and further <span class="ital">FE</span> to <span class="ital">HB</span>; therefore three parallelograms of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> are similar to three parallelograms of the solid <span class="ital">AL</span>. </p>

<p>But the former three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms, and the latter three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms; therefore the whole solid <span class="ital">CD</span> is similar to the whole solid <span class="ital">AL</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.def.9">XI. Def. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore on the given straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> there has been described <span class="ital">AL</span> similar and similarly situated to the given parallelepipedal solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
