<p><emph>To cut a given uncut straight line similarly to a given cut straight line</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To cut a given uncut straight line similarly to a given cut straight line</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given uncut straight line, and <em>AC</em> the straight line cut at the points <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>; and let them be so placed as to contain any angle; let <em>CB</em> be joined, and through <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> let <em>DF</em>, <em>EG</em> be drawn parallel to <em>BC</em>, and through <em>D</em> let <em>DHK</em> be drawn parallel to <em>AB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Therefore each of the figures <em>FH</em>, <em>HB</em> is a parallelogram; therefore <em>DH</em> is equal to <em>FG</em> and <em>HK</em> to <em>GB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since the straight line <em>HE</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>KC</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>DKC</em>, therefore, proportionally, as <em>CE</em> is to <em>ED</em>, so is <em>KH</em> to <em>HD</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] <pb n="214"/></p>

<p>But <em>KH</em> is equal to <em>BG</em>, and <em>HD</em> to <em>GF</em>; therefore, as <em>CE</em> is to <em>ED</em>, so is <em>BG</em> to <em>GF</em>. </p>

<p>Again, since <em>FD</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>GE</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>AGE</em>, therefore, proportionally, as <em>ED</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>GF</em> to <em>FA</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But it was also proved that, <span class="center">as <em>CE</em> is to <em>ED</em>, so is <em>BG</em> to <em>GF</em>; therefore, as <em>CE</em> is to <em>ED</em>, so is <em>BG</em> to <em>GF</em>, and, as <em>ED</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>GF</em> to <em>FA</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the given uncut straight line <em>AB</em> has been cut similarly to the given cut straight line <em>AC</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
