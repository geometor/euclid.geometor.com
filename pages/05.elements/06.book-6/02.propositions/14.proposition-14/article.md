<p><emph>In equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal</emph>. <pb n="217"/></p>

===

<p><em>In equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal</em>. <pb n="217"/></p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> be equal and equiangular parallelograms having the angles at <em>B</em> equal, and let <em>DB</em>, <em>BE</em> be placed in a straight line; <span class="center">therefore <em>FB</em>, <em>BG</em> are also in a straight line. [<a href="/elem.1.14">I. 14</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>I say that, in <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that, as <em>DB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>GB</em> to <em>BF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the parallelogram <em>FE</em> be completed. </p>

<p>Since, then, the parallelogram <em>AB</em> is equal to the parallelogram <em>BC</em>, <span class="center">and <em>FE</em> is another area,</span> therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>FE</em>, so is <em>BC</em> to <em>FE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>FE</em>, so is <em>DB</em> to <em>BE</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>FE</em>, so is <em>GB</em> to <em>BF</em>. [<em>id</em>.] therefore also, as <em>DB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>GB</em> to <em>BF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelograms <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>

<p>Next, let <em>GB</em> be to <em>BF</em> as <em>DB</em> to <em>BE</em>; I say that the parallelogram <em>AB</em> is equal to the parallelogram <em>BC</em>. </p>

<p>For since, as <em>DB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>GB</em> to <em>BF</em>, while, as <em>DB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>AB</em> to the parallelogram <em>FE</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and, as <em>GB</em> is to <em>BF</em>, so is the parallelogram <em>BC</em> to the parallelogram <em>FE</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore also, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>FE</em>, so is <em>BC</em> to <em>FE</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] therefore the parallelogram <em>AB</em> is equal to the parallelogram <em>BC</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
