<p><emph>In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the circumferences on which they stand</emph>, <emph>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the circumferences on which they stand</em>, <em>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> be equal circles, and let the angles <em>BGC</em>, <em>EHF</em> be angles at their centres <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, and the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>EDF</em> angles at the circumferences; I say that, as the circumference <em>BC</em> is to the circumference <em>EF</em>, so is the angle <em>BGC</em> to the angle <em>EHF</em>, and the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>EDF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let any number of consecutive circumferences <em>CK</em>, <em>KL</em> be made equal to the circumference <em>BC</em>, and any number of consecutive circumferences <em>FM</em>, <em>MN</em> equal to the circumference <em>EF</em>; and let <em>GK</em>, <em>GL</em>, <em>HM</em>, <em>HN</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since the circumferences <em>BC</em>, <em>CK</em>, <em>KL</em> are equal to one another, the angles <em>BGC</em>, <em>CGK</em>, <em>KGL</em> are also equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.3.27">III. 27</a>] <pb n="274"/>therefore, whatever multiple the circumference <em>BL</em> is of <em>BC</em>, that multiple also is the angle <em>BGL</em> of the angle <em>BGC</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason also, whatever multiple the circumference <em>NE</em> is of <em>EF</em>, that multiple also is the angle <em>NHE</em> of the angle <em>EHF</em>. </p>

<p>If then the circumference <em>BL</em> is equal to the circumference <em>EN</em>, the angle <em>BGL</em> is also equal to the angle <em>EHN</em>; [<a href="/elem.3.27">III. 27</a>] if the circumference <em>BL</em> is greater than the circumference <em>EN</em>, the angle <em>BGL</em> is also greater than the angle <em>EHN</em>; and, if less, less. </p>

<p>There being then four magnitudes, two circumferences <em>BC</em>, <em>EF</em>, and two angles <em>BGC</em>, <em>EHF</em>, there have been taken, of the circumference <em>BC</em> and the angle <em>BGC</em> equimultiples, namely the circumference <em>BL</em> and the angle <em>BGL</em>, and of the circumference <em>EF</em> and the angle <em>EHF</em> equimultiples, namely the circumference <em>EN</em> and the angle <em>EHN</em>. </p>

<p>And it has been proved that, if the circumference <em>BL</em> is in excess of the circumference <em>EN</em>, the angle <em>BGL</em> is also in excess of the angle <em>EHN</em>; if equal, equal; and if less, less. </p>

<p>Therefore, as the circumference <em>BC</em> is to <em>EF</em>, so is the angle <em>BGC</em> to the angle <em>EHF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the angle <em>BGC</em> is to the angle <em>EHF</em>, so is the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>EDF</em>; for they are doubles respectively. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the circumference <em>BC</em> is to the circumference <em>EF</em>, so is the angle <em>BGC</em> to the angle <em>EHF</em>, and the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>EDF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
