<p><emph>To two given straight lines to find a third proportional</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To two given straight lines to find a third proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em> be the two given straight lines, and let them be placed so as to contain any angle; thus it is required to find a third proportional to <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>For let them be produced to the points <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>, and let <em>BD</em> be made equal to <em>AC</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.3">I. 3</a>] let <em>BC</em> be joined, and through <em>D</em> let <em>DE</em> be drawn parallel to it. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Since, then, <em>BC</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>DE</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>ADE</em>, proportionally, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BD</em>, so is <em>AC</em> to <em>CE</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>BD</em> is equal to <em>AC</em>; therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so is <em>AC</em> to <em>CE</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore to two given straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>AC</em> a third proportional to them, <em>CE</em>, has been found. Q. E. F.
