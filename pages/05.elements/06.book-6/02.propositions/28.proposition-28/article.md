<p><emph>To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one : thus the given rectilineal figure must not be greater than the parallelogram described on the half of the straight line and similar to the defect</emph>. </p>

<p><em>To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one : thus the given rectilineal figure must not be greater than the parallelogram described on the half of the straight line and similar to the defect</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line, <em>C</em> the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to <em>AB</em> is required to be equal, not being greater than the parallelogram described on the half of <em>AB</em> and similar to the defect, and <em>D</em> the parallelogram to which the defect is required to be similar; <pb n="261"/>thus it is required to apply to the given straight line <em>AB</em> a parallelogram equal to the given rectilineal figure <em>C</em> and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure which is similar to <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be bisected at the point <em>E</em>, and on <em>EB</em> let <em>EBFG</em> be described similar and similarly situated to <em>D</em>; [<a href="/elem.6.18">VI. 18</a>] let the parallelogram <em>AG</em> be completed. </p>

<p>If then <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>C</em>, that which was enjoined will have been done; <span class="center">for there has been applied to the given straight line <em>AB</em> the parallelogram <em>AG</em> equal to the given rectilineal figure <em>C</em> and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure <em>GB</em> which is similar to <em>D</em>.</span>
       
      </p>

<p>But, if not, let <em>HE</em> be greater than <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Now <em>HE</em> is equal to <em>GB</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>GB</em> is also greater than <em>C</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <em>KLMN</em> be constructed at once equal to the excess by which <em>GB</em> is greater than <em>C</em> and similar and similarly situated to <em>D</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.25">VI. 25</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>D</em> is similar to <em>GB</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>KM</em> is also similar to <em>GB</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.21">VI. 21</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Let, then, <em>KL</em> correspond to <em>GE</em>, and <em>LM</em> to <em>GF</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since <em>GB</em> is equal to <em>C</em>, <em>KM</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>GB</em> is greater than <em>KM</em>; therefore also <em>GE</em> is greater than <em>KL</em>, and <em>GF</em> than <em>LM</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <em>GO</em> be made equal to <em>KL</em>, and <em>GP</em> equal to <em>LM</em>; and let the parallelogram <em>OGPQ</em> be completed; <span class="center">therefore it is equal and similar to <em>KM</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>GQ</em> is also similar to <em>GB</em>; [<a href="/elem.6.21">VI. 21</a>] therefore <em>GQ</em> is about the same diameter with <em>GB</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.26">VI. 26</a>] <pb n="262"/></p>

<p>Let <em>GQB</em> be their diameter, and let the figure be described. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>BG</em> is equal to <em>C</em>, <em>KM</em>, and in them <em>GQ</em> is equal to <em>KM</em>, therefore the remainder, the gnomon <em>UWV</em>, is equal to the remainder <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>And, since <em>PR</em> is equal to <em>OS</em>, <span class="center">let <em>QB</em> be added to each;</span> therefore the whole <em>PB</em> is equal to the whole <em>OB</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>OB</em> is equal to <em>TE</em>, since the side <em>AE</em> is also equal to the side <em>EB</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.36">I. 36</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>TE</em> is also equal to <em>PB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <em>OS</em> be added to each; <span class="center">therefore the whole <em>TS</em> is equal to the whole, the gnomon <em>VWU</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the gnomon <em>VWU</em> was proved equal to <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>TS</em> is also equal to <em>C</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore to the given straight line <em>AB</em> there has been applied the parallelogram <em>ST</em> equal to the given rectilineal figure <em>C</em> and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure <em>QB</em> which is similar to <em>D</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
