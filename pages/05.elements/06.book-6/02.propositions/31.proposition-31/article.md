<p><emph>In right</emph>-<emph>angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In right</em>-<em>angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <em>BAC</em> right; I say that the figure on <em>BC</em> is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AD</em> be drawn perpendicular. </p>

<p>Then since, in the right-angled triangle <em>ABC</em>, <em>AD</em> has <pb n="269"/>been drawn from the right angle at <em>A</em> perpendicular to the base <em>BC</em>, the triangles <em>ABD</em>, <em>ADC</em> adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole <em>ABC</em> and to one another. [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>] 
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>ABC</em> is similar to <em>ABD</em>, therefore, as <em>CB</em> is to <em>BA</em>, so is <em>AB</em> to <em>BD</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>And, since three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly described figure on the second. [<a href="/elem.6.19.p.1">VI. 19, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>CB</em> is to <em>BD</em>, so is the figure on <em>CB</em> to the similar and similarly described figure on <em>BA</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason also, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is the figure on <em>BC</em> to that on <em>CA</em>; so that, in addition, as <em>BC</em> is to <em>BD</em>, <em>DC</em>, so is the figure on <em>BC</em> to the similar and similarly described figures on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>BD</em>, <em>DC</em>; therefore the figure on <em>BC</em> is also equal to the similar and similarly described figures on <em>BA</em>, <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
