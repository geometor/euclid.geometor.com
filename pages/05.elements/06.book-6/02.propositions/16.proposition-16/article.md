<p><emph>If four straight lines be proportional</emph>, <emph>the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means; and</emph>, <emph>if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the rectangle contained by the means</emph>, <emph>the four straight lines will be proportional</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If four straight lines be proportional</em>, <em>the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means; and</em>, <em>if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the rectangle contained by the means</em>, <em>the four straight lines will be proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let the four straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> be proportional, so that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>; I say that the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> is equal to the rectangle contained by <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Let <em>AG</em>, <em>CH</em> be drawn from the points <em>A</em>, <em>C</em> at right angles to the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>, and let <em>AG</em> be made equal to <em>F</em>, and <em>CH</em> equal to <em>E</em>. </p>

<p>Let the parallelograms <em>BG</em>, <em>DH</em> be completed. </p>

<p>Then since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>, while <em>E</em> is equal to <em>CH</em>, and <em>F</em> to <em>AG</em>, therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>CH</em> to <em>AG</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore in the parallelograms <em>BG</em>, <em>DH</em> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. <pb n="222"/></p>

<p>But those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal; [<a href="/elem.6.14">VI. 14</a>] therefore the parallelogram <em>BG</em> is equal to the parallelogram <em>DH</em>. </p>

<p>And <em>BG</em> is the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em>, for <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>F</em>; and <em>DH</em> is the rectangle <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>, for <em>E</em> is equal to <em>CH</em>; therefore the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> is equal to the rectangle contained by <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>. </p>

<p>Next, let the rectangle contained by <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> be equal to the rectangle contained by <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>; I say that the four straight lines will be proportional, so that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, since the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> is equal to the rectangle <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>, and the rectangle <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> is <em>BG</em>, for <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>F</em>, and the rectangle <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em> is <em>DH</em>, for <em>CH</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>BG</em> is equal to <em>DH</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And they are equiangular </p>

<p>But in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. [<a href="/elem.6.14">VI. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>CH</em> to <em>AG</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>CH</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>AG</em> to <em>F</em>; therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
