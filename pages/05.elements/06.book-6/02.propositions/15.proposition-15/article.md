<p><em>In equal triangles which have one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle</em>, <em>and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional</em>, <em>are equal</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADE</em> be equal triangles having one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <em>BAC</em> to the angle <em>DAE</em>; I say that in the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADE</em> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that, <span class="center">as <em>CA</em> is to <em>AD</em>, so is <em>EA</em> to <em>AB</em>.</span>
       <pb n="220"/></p>

<p>For let them be placed so that <em>CA</em> is in a straight line with <em>AD</em>; therefore <em>EA</em> is also in a straight line with <em>AB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.14">I. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Let <em>BD</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Since then the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>ADE</em>, and <em>BAD</em> is another area, therefore, as the triangle <em>CAB</em> is to the triangle <em>BAD</em>, so is the triangle <em>EAD</em> to the triangle <em>BAD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] 
      </p>

<p>But, as <em>CAB</em> is to <em>BAD</em>, so is <em>CA</em> to <em>AD</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and, as <em>EAD</em> is to <em>BAD</em>, so is <em>EA</em> to <em>AB</em>. [<em>id</em>.] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <em>CA</em> is to <em>AD</em>, so is <em>EA</em> to <em>AB</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore in the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADE</em> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>

<p>Next, let the sides of the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADE</em> be reciprocally proportional, that is to say, let <em>EA</em> be to <em>AB</em> as <em>CA</em> to <em>AD</em>; I say that the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>ADE</em>. </p>

<p>For, if <em>BD</em> be again joined, since, as <em>CA</em> is to <em>AD</em>, so is <em>EA</em> to <em>AB</em>, while, as <em>CA</em> is to <em>AD</em>, so is the triangle <em>ABC</em> to the triangle <em>BAD</em>, and, as <em>EA</em> is to <em>AB</em>, so is the triangle <em>EAD</em> to the triangle <em>BAD</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore, as the triangle <em>ABC</em> is to the triangle <em>BAD</em>, so is the triangle <em>EAD</em> to the triangle <em>BAD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore each of the triangles <em>ABC</em>, <em>EAD</em> has the same ratio to <em>BAD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <em>ABC</em> is equal to the triangle <em>EAD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
