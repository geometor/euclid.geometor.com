<p><emph>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth</emph>, <emph>and the first be greater than the third</emph>, <emph>the second will also be greater than the fourth</emph>; <emph>if equal</emph>, <emph>equal</emph>; <emph>and if less</emph>, <emph>less</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth</em>, <em>and the first be greater than the third</em>, <em>the second will also be greater than the fourth</em>; <em>if equal</em>, <em>equal</em>; <em>and if less</em>, <em>less</em>. </p>

<p>For let a first magnitude <em>A</em> have the same ratio to a second <em>B</em> as a third <em>C</em> has to a fourth <em>D</em>; and let <em>A</em> be greater than <em>C</em>; I say that <em>B</em> is also greater than <em>D</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <em>A</em> is greater than <em>C</em>, and <em>B</em> is another, chance, magnitude, therefore <em>A</em> has to <em>B</em> a greater ratio than <em>C</em> has to <em>B</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.8">V. 8</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>C</em> has also to <em>D</em> a greater ratio than <em>C</em> has to <em>B</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.13">V. 13</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [<a href="/elem.5.10">V. 10</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>D</em> is less than <em>B</em>; so that <em>B</em> is greater than <em>D</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that, if <em>A</em> be equal to <em>C</em>, <em>B</em> will also be equal to <em>D</em>; and, if <em>A</em> be less than <em>C</em>, <em>B</em> will also be less than <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
