<p><emph>If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth</emph>, <emph>and if equimultiples be taken of the first and third</emph>, <emph>then also</emph> ex aequali <emph>the magnitudes taken will be equimultiples respectively</emph>, <emph>the one of the second and the other of the fourth</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth</em>, <em>and if equimultiples be taken of the first and third</em>, <em>then also</em> ex aequali <em>the magnitudes taken will be equimultiples respectively</em>, <em>the one of the second and the other of the fourth</em>. </p>

<p>Let a first magnitude <em>A</em> be the same multiple of a second <em>B</em> that a third <em>C</em> is of a fourth <em>D</em>, and let equimultiples <em>EF</em>, <em>GH</em> be taken of <em>A</em>, <em>C</em>; I say that <em>EF</em> is the same multiple of <em>B</em> that <em>GH</em> is of <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>For, since <em>EF</em> is the same multiple of <em>A</em> that <em>GH</em> is of <em>C</em>, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <em>EF</em> equal to <em>A</em>, so many also are there in <em>GH</em> equal to <em>C</em>. <pb n="141"/></p>

<p>Let <em>EF</em> be divded into the magnitudes <em>EK</em>, <em>KF</em> equal to <em>A</em>, and <em>GH</em> into the magnitudes <em>GL</em>, <em>LH</em> equal to <em>C</em>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <em>EK</em>, <em>KF</em> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <em>GL</em>, <em>LH</em>. 
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>A</em> is the same multiple of <em>B</em> that <em>C</em> is of <em>D</em>, while <em>EK</em> is equal to <em>A</em>, and <em>GL</em> to <em>C</em>, therefore <em>EK</em> is the same multiple of <em>B</em> that <em>GL</em> is of <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason </p>

<p><em>KF</em> is the same multiple of <em>B</em> that <em>LH</em> is of <em>D</em>. </p>

<p>Since, then, a first magnitude <em>EK</em> is the same multiple of a second <em>B</em> that a third <em>GL</em> is of a fourth <em>D</em>, and a fifth <em>KF</em> is also the same multiple of the second <em>B</em> that a sixth <em>LH</em> is of the fourth <em>D</em>, therefore the sum of the first and fifth, <em>EF</em>, is also the same multiple of the second <em>B</em> that the sum of the third and sixth, <em>GH</em>, is of the fourth <em>D</em>.

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
