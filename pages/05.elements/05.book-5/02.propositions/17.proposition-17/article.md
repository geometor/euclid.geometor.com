<p><emph>If magnitudes be proportional</emph>

===

<p><em>If magnitudes be proportional</em>
       <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, <em>they will also be proportional</em>
       <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em>, <em>BE</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DF</em> be magnitudes proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, so that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>CD</em> to <em>DF</em>; I say that they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, that is, as <em>AE</em> is to <em>EB</em>, so is <em>CF</em> to <em>DF</em>. </p>

<p>For of <em>AE</em>, <em>EB</em>, <em>CF</em>, <em>FD</em> let equimultiples <em>GH</em>, <em>HK</em>, <em>LM</em>, <em>MN</em> be taken, and of <em>EB</em>, <em>FD</em> other, chance, equimultiples, <em>KO</em>, <em>NP</em>. <pb n="167"/></p>

<p>Then, since <em>GH</em> is the same multiple of <em>AE</em> that <em>HK</em> is of <em>EB</em>, therefore <em>GH</em> is the same multiple of <em>AE</em> that <em>GK</em> is of <em>AB</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.1">V. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>GH</em> is the same multiple of <em>AE</em> that <em>LM</em> is of <em>CF</em>; therefore <em>GK</em> is the same multiple of <em>AB</em> that <em>LM</em> is of <em>CF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>LM</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>MN</em> is of <em>FD</em>, therefore <em>LM</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>LN</em> is of <em>CD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.1">V. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But <em>LM</em> was the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>GK</em> is of <em>AB</em>; therefore <em>GK</em> is the same multiple of <em>AB</em> that <em>LN</em> is of <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore <em>GK</em>, <em>LN</em> are equimultiples of <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>Again, since <em>HK</em> is the same multiple of <em>EB</em> that <em>MN</em> is of <em>FD</em>, <span class="center">and <em>KO</em> is also the same multiple of <em>EB</em> that <em>NP</em> is of <em>FD</em>, therefore the sum <em>HO</em> is also the same multiple of <em>EB</em> that <em>MP</em> is of <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.2">V. 2</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>BE</em>, so is <em>CD</em> to <em>DF</em>, and of <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> equimultiples <em>GK</em>, <em>LN</em> have been taken, and of <em>EB</em>, <em>FD</em> equimultiples <em>HO</em>, <em>MP</em>, therefore, if <em>GK</em> is in excess of <em>HO</em>, <em>LN</em> is also in excess of <em>MP</em>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. </p>

<p>Let <em>GK</em> be in excess of <em>HO</em>; then, if <em>HK</em> be subtracted from each, <span class="center"><em>GH</em> is also in excess of <em>KO</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But we saw that, if <em>GK</em> was in excess of <em>HO</em>, <em>LN</em> was also in excess of <em>MP</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>LN</em> is also in excess of <em>MP</em>,</span>
       <pb n="168"/>and, if <em>MN</em> be subtracted from each, <span class="center"><em>LM</em> is also in excess of <em>NP</em>;</span> so that, if <em>GH</em> is in excess of <em>KO</em>, <em>LM</em> is also in excess of <em>NP</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that, if <em>GH</em> be equal to <em>KO</em>, <em>LM</em> will also be equal to <em>NP</em>, and if less, less. </p>

<p>And <em>GH</em>, <em>LM</em> are equimultiples of <em>AE</em>, <em>CF</em>, while <em>KO</em>, <em>NP</em> are other, chance, equimultiples of <em>EB</em>, <em>FD</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>AE</em> is to <em>EB</em>, so is <em>CF</em> to <em>FD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
