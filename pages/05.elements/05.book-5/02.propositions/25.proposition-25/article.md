<p><emph>If four magnitudes be proportional</emph>, <emph>the greatest and the least are greater than the remaining two</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If four magnitudes be proportional</em>, <em>the greatest and the least are greater than the remaining two</em>. </p>

<p>Let the four magnitudes <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> be proportional so that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>, and let <em>AB</em> be the greatest of them and <em>F</em> the least; I say that <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> are greater than <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>AG</em> be made equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>CH</em> equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>, and <em>E</em> is equal to <em>AG</em>, and <em>F</em> to <em>CH</em>, <span class="center">therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>AG</em> to <em>CH</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And since, as the whole <em>AB</em> is to the whole <em>CD</em>, so is the part <em>AG</em> subtracted to the part <em>CH</em> subtracted, <span class="center">the remainder <em>GB</em> will also be to the remainder <em>HD</em> as the whole <em>AB</em> is to the whole <em>CD</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.19">V. 19</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>AB</em> is greater than <em>CD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>GB</em> is also greater than <em>HD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, and <em>CH</em> to <em>F</em>, therefore <em>AG</em>, <em>F</em> are equal to <em>CH</em>, <em>E</em>. </p>

<p>And if, <em>GB</em>, <em>HD</em> being unequal, and <em>GB</em> greater, <em>AG</em>, <em>F</em> be added to <em>GB</em> and <em>CH</em>, <em>E</em> be added to <em>HD</em>, <span class="center">it follows that <em>AB</em>, <em>F</em> are greater than <em>CD</em>, <em>E</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
