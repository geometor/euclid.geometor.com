<p><emph>Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio</emph>, <emph>as also has the same to equal magnitudes</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio</em>, <em>as also has the same to equal magnitudes</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> be equal magnitudes and <em>C</em> any other, chance, magnitude; I say that each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> has the same ratio to <em>C</em>, and <em>C</em> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let equimultiples <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> be taken, and of <em>C</em> another, chance, multiple <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>D</em> is the same multiple of <em>A</em> that <em>E</em> is of <em>B</em>, while <em>A</em> is equal to <em>B</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>D</em> is equal to <em>E</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>F</em> is another, chance, magnitude. <pb n="149"/></p>

<p>If therefore <em>D</em> is in excess of <em>F</em>, <em>E</em> is also in excess of <em>F</em>, if equal to it, equal; and, if less, less. </p>

<p>And <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, while <em>F</em> is another, chance, multiple of <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next that <em>C</em> also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <em>D</em> is equal to <em>E</em>; and <em>F</em> is some other magnitude. </p>

<p>If therefore <em>F</em> is in excess of <em>D</em>, it is also in excess of <em>E</em>, if equal, equal; and, if less, less. </p>

<p>And <em>F</em> is a multiple of <em>C</em>, while <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> are other, chance, equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>C</em> is to <em>A</em>, so is <em>C</em> to <em>B</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. </p>

<p>From this it is manifest that, if any magnitudes are proportional, they will also be proportional inversely. Q. E. D.</p>
