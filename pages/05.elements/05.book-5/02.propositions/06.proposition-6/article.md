===

<p><em>If two magnitudes be equimultiples of two magnitudes</em>, <em>and any magnitudes subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same</em>, <em>the remainders also are either equal to the same or equimultiples of them</em>. </p>

<p>For let two magnitudes <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> be equimultiples of two magnitudes <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, and let <em>AG</em>, <em>CH</em> subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same two <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>;  I say that the remainders also, <em>GB</em>, <em>HD</em>, are either equal to <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> or equimultiples of them. </p>

<p>For, first, let <em>GB</em> be equal to <em>E</em>; I say that <em>HD</em> is also equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>CK</em> be made equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Since <em>AG</em> is the same multiple of <em>E</em> that <em>CH</em> is of <em>F</em>, while <em>GB</em> is equal to <em>E</em> and <em>KC</em> to <em>F</em>, therefore <em>AB</em> is the same multiple of <em>E</em> that <em>KH</em> is of <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.2">V. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, <em>AB</em> is the same multiple of <em>E</em> that <em>CD</em> is of <em>F</em>; therefore <em>KH</em> is the same multiple of <em>F</em> that <em>CD</em> is of <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Since then each of the magnitudes <em>KH</em>, <em>CD</em> is the same multiple of <em>F</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>KH</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>.</span>
       <pb n="148"/></p>

<p>Let <em>CH</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <em>KC</em> is equal to the remainder <em>HD</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>F</em> is equal to <em>KC</em>; therefore <em>HD</em> is also equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Hence, if <em>GB</em> is equal to <em>E</em>, <em>HD</em> is also equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that, even if <em>GB</em> be a multiple of <em>E</em>, <em>HD</em> is also the same multiple of <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
