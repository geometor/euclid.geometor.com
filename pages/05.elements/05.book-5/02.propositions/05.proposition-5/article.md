<p><emph>If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted</emph>, <emph>the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole</emph>. <lb n="5"/></p>

===

<p><em>If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted</em>, <em>the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole</em>. <lb n="5"/></p>

<p>For let the magnitude <em>AB</em> be the same multiple of the magnitude <em>CD</em> that the part <em>AE</em> subtracted is of the part <em>CF</em> subtracted; I say that the remainder <em>EB</em> is also the same multiple of the remainder <em>FD</em> that the whole <em>AB</em> is of the whole <em>CD</em>. 
       <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>For, whatever multiple <em>AE</em> is of <em>CF</em>, let <em>EB</em> be made that multiple of <em>CG</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AE</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>EB</em> is of <em>GC</em>, therefore <em>AE</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>AB</em> is of <em>GF</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.1">V. 1</a>] <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>But, by the assumption, <em>AE</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>AB</em> is of <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore <em>AB</em> is the same multiple of each of the magnitudes <em>GF</em>, <em>CD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>GF</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>.</span>
       <lb n="20"/></p>

<p>Let <em>CF</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <em>GC</em> is equal to the remainder <em>FD</em>. <pb n="146"/></p>

<p>And, since <em>AE</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>EB</em> is of <em>GC</em>, and <em>GC</em> is equal to <em>DF</em>, <lb n="25"/>therefore <em>AE</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>EB</em> is of <em>FD</em>. </p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, </p>

<p><em>AE</em> is the same multiple of <em>CF</em> that <em>AB</em> is of <em>CD</em>; therefore <em>EB</em> is the same multiple of <em>FD</em> that <em>AB</em> is of <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>That is, the remainder <em>EB</em> will be the same multiple of <lb n="30"/>the remainder <em>FD</em> that the whole <em>AB</em> is of the whole <em>CD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

<p><span class="bold">let EB be made that multiple of CG</span>, <foreign lang="greek">τοσαυταπλάσιον γεγονέτω καὶ τὸ ΕΒ τοῦ ΓΗ</foreign>. From this way of stating the construction one might suppose that <em>CG</em> was given and <em>EB</em> had to be found equal to a certain multiple of it. But in fact <em>EB</em> is what is given and <em>CG</em> has to be found, i.e. <em>CG</em> has to be constructed as a certain <em>sub</em>multiple of <em>EB</em>.</p>
