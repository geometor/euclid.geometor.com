<p><emph>If two circles touch one another internally</emph>, <emph>and their centres be taken</emph>, <emph>the straight line joining their centres</emph>, <emph>if it be also produced</emph>, <emph>will fall on the point of contact of the circles</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If two circles touch one another internally</em>, <em>and their centres be taken</em>, <em>the straight line joining their centres</em>, <em>if it be also produced</em>, <em>will fall on the point of contact of the circles</em>. </p>

<p>For let the two circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADE</em> touch one another internally at the point <em>A</em>, and let the centre <em>F</em> of the circle <em>ABC</em>, and the centre <em>G</em> of <em>ADE</em>, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from <em>G</em> to <em>F</em> and produced will fall on <em>A</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as <em>FGH</em>, and let <em>AF</em>, <em>AG</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AG</em>, <em>GF</em> are greater than <em>FA</em>, that is, than <em>FH</em>, </p>

<p>let <em>FG</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <em>AG</em> is greater than the remainder <em>GH</em>. <pb n="25"/></p>

<p>But <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>GD</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>GD</em> is also greater than <em>GH</em>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line joined from <em>F</em> to <em>G</em> will not fall outside; <span class="center">therefore it will fall at <em>A</em> on the point of contact.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
