<p><emph>From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>A</em> be the given point, and <em>BCD</em> the given circle; thus it is required to draw from the point <em>A</em> a straight line touching the circle <em>BCD</em>. </p>

<p>For let the centre <em>E</em> of the circle be taken; [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>] let <em>AE</em> be joined, and with centre <em>E</em> and distance <em>EA</em> let the circle <em>AFG</em> be described;  from <em>D</em> let <em>DF</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>EA</em>, and let <em>EF</em>, <em>AB</em> be joined; I say that <em>AB</em> has been drawn from the point <em>A</em> touching the circle <em>BCD</em>. </p>

<p>For, since <em>E</em> is the centre of the circles <em>BCD</em>, <em>AFG</em>, <span class="center"><em>EA</em> is equal to <em>EF</em>, and <em>ED</em> to <em>EB</em>;</span> therefore the two sides <em>AE</em>, <em>EB</em> are equal to the two sides <em>FE</em>, <em>ED</em>: and they contain a common angle, the angle at <em>E</em>; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>DF</em> is equal to the base <em>AB</em>, and the triangle <em>DEF</em> is equal to the triangle <em>BEA</em>, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the angle <em>EDF</em> is equal to the angle <em>EBA</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>EDF</em> is right; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>EBA</em> is also right.</span>
      </p>

<p>Now <em>EB</em> is a radius; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>] <span class="center">therefore <em>AB</em> touches the circle <em>BCD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore from the given point <em>A</em> the straight line <em>AB</em> has been drawn touching the circle <em>BCD</em>.</p>
