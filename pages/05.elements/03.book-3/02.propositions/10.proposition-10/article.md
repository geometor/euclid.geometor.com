<p><emph>A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two</em>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let the circle <em>ABC</em> cut the circle <em>DEF</em> at more points than two, namely <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>H</em>; </p>

<p>let <em>BH</em>, <em>BG</em> be joined and bisected at the points <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>, and from <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> let <em>KC</em>, <em>LM</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>BH</em>, <em>BG</em> and carried through to the points <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since in the circle <em>ABC</em> a straight line <em>AC</em> cuts a straight line <em>BH</em> into two equal parts and at right angles, <span class="center">the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em> is on <em>AC</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.1.p.1">III. 1, Por.</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since in the same circle <em>ABC</em> a straight line <em>NO</em> cuts a straight line <em>BG</em> into two equal parts and at right angles, <span class="center">the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em> is on <em>NO</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was also proved to be on <em>AC</em>, and the straight lines <em>AC</em>, <em>NO</em> meet at no point except at <em>P</em>; <span class="center">therefore the point <em>P</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <em>P</em> is also the centre of the circle <em>DEF</em>; <span class="center">therefore the two circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> which cut one another have the same centre <em>P</em>: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.3.5">III. 5</a>]</span>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

<p>The word circle (<foreign lang="greek">κύκλος</foreign>) is here employed in the unusual sense of the <em>circumference</em> (<foreign lang="greek">περιφέρεια</foreign>) of a circle. Cf. blockquote on <a href="/elem.1.def.15">I. Def. 15</a>.</p>
