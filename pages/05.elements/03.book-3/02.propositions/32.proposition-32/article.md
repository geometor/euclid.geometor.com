===

<p><em>If a straight line touch a circle</em>, <em>and from the point of contact there be drawn across</em>, <em>in the circle</em>, <em>a straight line cutting the circle</em>, <em>the angles which it makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle</em>. </p>

<p>For let a straight line <em>EF</em> touch the circle <em>ABCD</em> at the point <em>B</em>, and from the point <em>B</em> let there be drawn across, in the circle <em>ABCD</em>, a straight line <em>BD</em> cutting it; I say that the angles which <em>BD</em> makes with the tangent <em>EF</em> will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the <pb n="66"/>circle, that is, that the angle <em>FBD</em> is equal to the angle constructed in the segment <em>BAD</em>, and the angle <em>EBD</em> is equal to the angle constructed in the segment <em>DCB</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>BA</em> be drawn from <em>B</em> at right angles to <em>EF</em>, let a point <em>C</em> be taken at random on the circumference <em>BD</em>,  and let <em>AD</em>, <em>DC</em>, <em>CB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since a straight line <em>EF</em> touches the circle <em>ABCD</em> at <em>B</em>, and <em>BA</em> has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle <em>ABCD</em> is on <em>BA</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.19">III. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <em>BA</em> is a diameter of the circle <em>ABCD</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>ADB</em>, being an angle in a semicircle, is right. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the remaining angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>ABD</em> are equal to one right angle. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <em>ABF</em> is also right; therefore the angle <em>ABF</em> is equal to the angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>ABD</em>. </p>

<p>Let the angle <em>ABD</em> be subtracted from each; therefore the angle <em>DBF</em> which remains is equal to the angle <em>BAD</em> in the alternate segment of the circle. </p>

<p>Next, since <em>ABCD</em> is a quadrilateral in a circle, its opposite angles are equal to two right angles. [<a href="/elem.3.22">III. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But the angles <em>DBF</em>, <em>DBE</em> are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles <em>DBF</em>, <em>DBE</em> are equal to the angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>BCD</em>, <span class="center">of which the angle <em>BAD</em> was proved equal to the angle <em>DBF</em>; therefore the angle <em>DBE</em> which remains is equal to the angle <em>DCB</em> in the alternate segment <em>DCB</em> of the circle.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
