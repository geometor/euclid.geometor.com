<p><emph>If a point be taken within a circle</emph>, <emph>and more than two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle</emph>, <emph>the point taken is the centre of the circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If a point be taken within a circle</em>, <em>and more than two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle</em>, <em>the point taken is the centre of the circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a circle and <em>D</em> a point within it, and from <em>D</em> let more than two equal straight lines, namely <em>DA</em>, <em>DB</em>, <em>DC</em>, fall on the circle <em>ABC</em>; I say that the point <em>D</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em> be joined and bisected at the points <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, and let <em>ED</em>, <em>FD</em> be joined and drawn through to the points <em>G</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>L</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>EB</em>, and <em>ED</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>AE</em>, <em>ED</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BE</em>, <em>ED</em>;</span> and the base <em>DA</em> is equal to the base <em>DB</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>AED</em> is equal to the angle <em>BED</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore each of the angles <em>AED</em>, <em>BED</em> is right; [<a href="/elem.1.def.10">I. Def. 10</a>] therefore <em>GK</em> cuts <em>AB</em> into two equal parts and at right angles. </p>

<p>And since, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line, [<a href="/elem.3.1.p.1">III. 1, Por.</a>] <span class="center">the centre of the circle is on <em>GK</em>.</span>
       <pb n="22"/></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em> is also on <em>HL</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And the straight lines <em>GK</em>, <em>HL</em> have no other point common but the point <em>D</em>; <span class="center">therefore the point <em>D</em> is the centre of the circle <em>ABC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
