<p><em>If on the diameter of a circle a point be taken which is not the centre of the circle</em>, <em>and from the point straight lines fall upon the circle</em>, <em>that will be greatest on which the centre is</em>, <em>the remainder of the same diameter will be least</em>, <em>and of the rest</em>
       <lb n="5"/><em>the nearer to the straight line through the centre is always greater than the more remote</em>, <em>and only two equal straight lines will fall from the point on the circle</em>, <em>one on each side of the least straight line</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a circle, and let <em>AD</em> be a diameter of it; <lb n="10"/>on <em>AD</em> let a point <em>F</em> be taken which is not the centre of the circle, let <em>E</em> be the centre of the circle, and from <em>F</em> let straight lines <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em>, <em>FG</em> fall upon the circle <em>ABCD</em>; I say that <em>FA</em> is greatest, <em>FD</em> is least, and of the rest <em>FB</em> is <lb n="15"/>greater than <em>FC</em>, and <em>FC</em> than <em>FG</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>BE</em>, <em>CE</em>, <em>GE</em> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining one, [<a href="/elem.1.20">I. 20</a>] <lb n="20"/><span class="center"><em>EB</em>, <em>EF</em> are greater than <em>BF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>BE</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>AF</em> is greater than <em>BF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>CE</em>, and <em>FE</em> is common, <lb n="25"/>the two sides <em>BE</em>, <em>EF</em> are equal to the two sides <em>CE</em>, <em>EF</em>. </p>

<p>But the angle <em>BEF</em> is also greater than the angle <em>CEF</em>; therefore the base <em>BF</em> is greater than the base <em>CF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.24">I. 24</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center"><em>CF</em> is also greater than <em>FG</em>.</span>
       <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>Again, since <em>GF</em>, <em>FE</em> are greater than <em>EG</em>, and <em>EG</em> is equal to <em>ED</em>, <span class="center"><em>GF</em>, <em>FE</em> are greater than <em>ED</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <em>EF</em> be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore the remainder <em>GF</em> is greater than the remainder <lb n="35"/><em>FD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>FA</em> is greatest, <em>FD</em> is least, and <em>FB</em> is greater than <em>FC</em>, and <em>FC</em> than <em>FG</em>. <pb n="15"/></p>

<p>I say also that from the point <em>F</em> only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle <em>ABCD</em>, one on each side of the <lb n="40"/>least <em>FD</em>. </p>

<p>For on the straight line <em>EF</em>, and at the point <em>E</em> on it, let the angle <em>FEH</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>GEF</em> [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>], and let <em>FH</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>GE</em> is equal to <em>EH</em>, <lb n="45"/>and <em>EF</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>GE</em>, <em>EF</em> are equal to the two sides <em>HE</em>, <em>EF</em>; and the angle <em>GEF</em> is equal to the angle <em>HEF</em>;</span>
       <span class="center">therefore the base <em>FG</em> is equal to the base <em>FH</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>I say again that another straight line equal to <em>FG</em> will not <lb n="50"/>fall on the circle from the point <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <em>FK</em> so fall. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>FK</em> is equal to <em>FG</em>, and <em>FH</em> to <em>FG</em>, <span class="center"><em>FK</em> is also equal to <em>FH</em>, the nearer to the straight line through the centre being <lb n="55"/>thus equal to the more remote: which is impossible.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore another straight line equal to <em>GF</em> will not fall from the point <em>F</em> upon the circle; <span class="center">therefore only one straight line will so fall.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
