<p><emph>The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be a circle, and let <em>ABCD</em> be a quadrilateral in it; I say that the opposite angles are equal to two right angles. </p>

<p>Let <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since in any triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles, [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] <pb n="52"/><span class="center">the three angles <em>CAB</em>, <em>ABC</em>, <em>BCA</em> of the triangle <em>ABC</em> are equal to two right angles.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>CAB</em> is equal to the angle <em>BDC</em>, for they are in the same segment <em>BADC</em>; [<a href="/elem.3.21">III. 21</a>] and the angle <em>ACB</em> is equal to the angle 
       <em>ADB</em>, for they are in the same segment <em>ADCB</em>; therefore the whole angle <em>ADC</em> is equal to the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>ACB</em>. </p>

<p>Let the angle <em>ABC</em> be added to each; therefore the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BAC</em>, <em>ACB</em> are equal to the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADC</em>. But the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BAC</em>, <em>ACB</em> are equal to two right angles; therefore the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>ADC</em> are also equal to two right angles. </p>

<p>Similarly we can prove that the angles <em>BAD</em>, <em>DCB</em> are also equal to two right angles. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
