===

<p>
       <span class="ital">To set out the sides of the five figures and to compare them with one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, the diameter of the given sphere, be set out, and let it be cut at <span class="ital">C</span> so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CB</span>, and at <span class="ital">D</span> so that <span class="ital">AD</span> is double of <span class="ital">DB</span>; let the semicircle <span class="ital">AEB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, from <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> let <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is double of <span class="ital">DB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of <span class="ital">BD</span>. 
      </p>

<p><foreign lang="la">Convertendo</foreign>, therefore, <span class="ital">BA</span> is one and a half times <span class="ital">AD</span>. <pb n="504"/></p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="ital">AF</span>, [<a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>, <a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>] for the triangle <span class="ital">AFB</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">AFD</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is one and a half times the square on <span class="ital">AF</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid. [<a href="/elem.13.13">XIII. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the sphere; therefore <span class="ital">AF</span> is equal to the side of the pyramid. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is double of <span class="ital">DB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>, <a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also triple of the square on the side of the cube. [<a href="/elem.13.15">XIII. 15</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the sphere; therefore <span class="ital">BF</span> is the side of the cube. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of the square on <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also double of the square on the side of the octahedron. [<a href="/elem.13.14">XIII. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore <span class="ital">BE</span> is the side of the octahedron. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">AG</span> be drawn from the point <span class="ital">A</span> at right angles to the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">AG</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, let <span class="ital">GC</span> be joined, and from <span class="ital">H</span> let <span class="ital">HK</span> be drawn perpendicular to <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">GA</span> is double of <span class="ital">AC</span>, for <span class="ital">GA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and, as <span class="ital">GA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is <span class="ital">HK</span> to <span class="ital">KC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is also double of <span class="ital">KC</span>. <pb n="505"/></p>

<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">KC</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KC</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">HC</span>, is five times the square on <span class="ital">KC</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">HC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">CK</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of <span class="ital">CB</span>, and, in them, <span class="ital">AD</span> is double of <span class="ital">DB</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">BD</span> is double of the remainder <span class="ital">DC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is triple of <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is nine times the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">CK</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">CK</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CK</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">CL</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">CK</span>, from <span class="ital">L</span> let <span class="ital">LM</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">MB</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">CK</span>, and <span class="ital">AB</span> is double of <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">KL</span> double of <span class="ital">CK</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also five times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described. [<a href="/elem.13.16.p.1">XIII. 16, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the sphere; therefore <span class="ital">KL</span> is the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described; therefore <span class="ital">KL</span> is a side of the hexagon in the said circle. [<a href="/elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the diameter of the sphere is made up of the side of the hexagon and two of the sides of the decagon inscribed in the same circle, [<a href="/elem.13.16.p.1">XIII. 16, Por.</a>] and <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the sphere, while <span class="ital">KL</span> is a side of the hexagon, and <span class="ital">AK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LB</span>, therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">LB</span> is a side of the decagon inscribed in the circle from which the icosahedron has been described. <pb n="506"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">LB</span> belongs to a decagon, and <span class="ital">ML</span> to a hexagon, for <span class="ital">ML</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KL</span>, since it is also equal to <span class="ital">HK</span>, being the same distance from the centre, and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> is double of <span class="ital">KC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">MB</span> belongs to a pentagon. [<a href="/elem.13.10">XIII. 10</a>] </p>

<p>But the side of the pentagon is the side of the icosahedron; [<a href="/elem.13.16">XIII. 16</a>] therefore <span class="ital">MB</span> belongs to the icosahedron. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">FB</span> is a side of the cube, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">NB</span> be the greater segment; therefore <span class="ital">NB</span> is a side of the dodecahedron. [<a href="/elem.13.17.p.1">XIII. 17, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the square on the diameter of the sphere was proved to be one and a half times the square on the side <span class="ital">AF</span> of the pyramid, double of the square on the side <span class="ital">BE</span> of the octahedron and triple of the side <span class="ital">FB</span> of the cube, therefore, of parts of which the square on the diameter of the sphere contains six, the square on the side of the pyramid contains four, the square on the side of the octahedron three, and the square on the side of the cube two. </p>

<p>Therefore the square on the side of the pyramid is fourthirds of the square on the side of the octahedron, and double of the square on the side of the cube; and the square on the side of the octahedron is one and a half times the square on the side of the cube. </p>

<p>The said sides, therefore, of the three figures, I mean the pyramid, the octahedron and the cube, are to one another in rational ratios. </p>

<p>But the remaining two, I mean the side of the icosahedron and the side of the dodecahedron, are not in rational ratios either to one another or to the aforesaid sides; for they are irrational, the one being minor [<a href="/elem.13.16">XIII. 16</a>] and the other an apotome [<a href="/elem.13.17">XIII. 17</a>]. </p>

<p>That the side <span class="ital">MB</span> of the icosahedron is greater than the side <span class="ital">NB</span> of the dodecahedron we can prove thus. </p>

<p>For, since the triangle <span class="ital">FDB</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">FAB</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>] proportionally, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BF</span>, so is <span class="ital">BF</span> to <span class="ital">BA</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] <pb n="507"/></p>

<p>And, since the three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the square on the first to the square on the second; [<a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>, <a href="/elem.6.20.p.1">VI. 20, Por.</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BA</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">DB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BF</span>; therefore, inversely, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">FB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is triple of <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">FB</span> is triple of the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> is also quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>, for <span class="ital">AD</span> is double of <span class="ital">DB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AD</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is greater than <span class="ital">FB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AL</span> is by far greater than <span class="ital">FB</span>. </p>

<p>And, when <span class="ital">AL</span> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">KL</span> is the greater segment, inasmuch as <span class="ital">LK</span> belongs to a hexagon, and <span class="ital">KA</span> to a decagon; [<a href="/elem.13.9">XIII. 9</a>] and, when <span class="ital">FB</span> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">NB</span> is the greater segment; therefore <span class="ital">KL</span> is greater than <span class="ital">NB</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LM</span>; therefore <span class="ital">LM</span> is greater than <span class="ital">NB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MB</span>, which is a side of the icosahedron, is by far greater than <span class="ital">NB</span> which is a side of the dodecahedron. Q. E. D. </p>

<p>I say next that <span class="ital">no other figure</span>, <span class="ital">besides the said five figures</span>, <span class="ital">can be constructed which is contained by equilateral and equiangular figures equal to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>For a solid angle cannot be constructed with two triangles, or indeed planes. </p>

<p>With three triangles the angle of the pyramid is constructed, with four the angle of the octahedron, and with five the angle of the icosahedron; but a solid angle cannot be formed by six equilateral and equiangular triangles placed together at one point, <pb n="508"/>for, the angle of the equilateral triangle being two-thirds of a right angle, the six will be equal to four right angles: which is impossible, for any solid angle is contained by angles less than four right angles. [<a href="/elem.11.21">XI. 21</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason, neither can a solid angle be constructed by more than six plane angles. </p>

<p>By three squares the angle of the cube is contained, but by four it is impossible for a solid angle to be contained, for they will again be four right angles. </p>

<p>By three equilateral and equiangular pentagons the angle of the dodecahedron is contained; but by four such it is impossible for any solid angle to be contained, for, the angle of the equilateral pentagon being a right angle and a fifth, the four angles will be greater than four right angles: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Neither again will a solid angle be contained by other polygonal figures by reason of the same absurdity. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
<div id="elem.13.18.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>But that <span class="ital">the angle of the equilateral and equiangular pentagon is a right angle and a fifth</span> we must prove thus. </p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> be an equilateral and equiangular pentagon, let the circle <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> be circumscribed about it, let its centre <span class="ital">F</span> be taken, and let <span class="ital">FA</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span>, <span class="ital">FC</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span> be joined. </p>

       
<p>Therefore they bisect the angles of the pentagon at <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. 
       </p>

       
<p>And, since the angles at <span class="ital">F</span> are equal to four right angles and are equal, <pb n="509"/>therefore one of them, as the angle <span class="ital">AFB</span>, is one right angle less a fifth; therefore the remaining angles <span class="ital">FAB</span>, <span class="ital">ABF</span> consist of one right angle and a fifth. </p>

       
<p>But the angle <span class="ital">FAB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">FBC</span>; therefore the whole angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> of the pentagon consists of one right angle and a fifth. Q. E. D.</p>
