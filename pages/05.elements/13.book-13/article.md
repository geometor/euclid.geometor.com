> The five regular solids—the cube, tetrahedron (i.e., pyramid), octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron—were problably discovered by the school of Pythagoras. They are generally termed “Platonic” solids because they feature prominently in Plato’s famous dialogue Timaeus. Many of the theorems contained in this book—particularly those which pertain to the last two solids—are ascribed to Theaetetus of Athens.
