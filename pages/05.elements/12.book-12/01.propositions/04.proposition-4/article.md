<p><span class="ital">If there be two pyramids of the same height which have triangular bases</span>, <span class="ital">and cach of them be divded into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole, and into two equal prisms</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>, <span class="ital">as the base of the one pyramid is to the base of the other pyramid</span>, <span class="ital">so will all the prisms in the one pyramid be to all the prisms</span>, <span class="ital">being equal in multitude</span>, <span class="ital">in the other pyramid.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be two pyramids of the same height which have the triangular bases <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>, and vertices the points <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, and let each of them be divded into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms; [<a href="/elem.12.3">XII. 3</a>] I say that, as the base <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="ital">DEF</span>, so are all the prisms in the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCG</span> to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <span class="ital">DEFH</span>, <pb n="383"/></p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">BO</span> is equal to <span class="ital">OC</span>, and <span class="ital">AL</span> to <span class="ital">LC</span>, therefore <span class="ital">LO</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For the same reason the triangle <span class="ital">DEF</span> is also similar to the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CO</span>, and <span class="ital">EF</span> of <span class="ital">FV</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">CO</span>, so is <span class="ital">EF</span> to <span class="ital">FV</span>. </p>

<p>And on <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CO</span> are described the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">LOC</span>, and on <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FV</span> the similar and similarly situated figures <span class="ital">DEF</span>, <span class="ital">RVF</span>; therefore, as the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span>, so is the triangle <span class="ital">DEF</span> to the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.22">VI. 22</a>] therefore, alternately, as the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="ital">DEF</span>, so is the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> to the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> is to the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span>, so is the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="ital">PMN</span> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="ital">STU</span> its opposite; [Lemma following] therefore also, as the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="ital">DEF</span>, so is the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="ital">PMN</span> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="ital">STU</span> its opposite. </p>

<p>But, as the said prisms are to one another, so is the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">KBOL</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">PM</span> its opposite to the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">QEVR</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">ST</span> its opposite. [<a href="/elem.11.39">XI. 39</a>; cf. <a href="/elem.12.3">XII. 3</a>] <pb n="384"/></p>

<p>Therefore also the two prisms, that in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">KBOL</span> is the base and <span class="ital">PM</span> its opposite, and that in which the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="ital">PMN</span> its opposite, are to the prisms in which <span class="ital">QEVR</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">ST</span> its opposite and in which the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="ital">STU</span> its opposite in the same ratio [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the base <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="ital">DEF</span>, so are the said two prisms to the said two prisms. </p>

<p>And similarly, if the pyramids <span class="ital">PMNG</span>, <span class="ital">STUH</span> be divded into two prisms and two pyramids, as the base <span class="ital">PMN</span> is to the base <span class="ital">STU</span>, so will the two prisms in the pyramid <span class="ital">PMNG</span> be to the two prisms in the pyramid <span class="ital">STUH</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the base <span class="ital">PMN</span> is to the base <span class="ital">STU</span>, so is the base <span class="ital">ABC</span> to the base <span class="ital">DEF</span>; for the triangles <span class="ital">PMN</span>, <span class="ital">STU</span> are equal to the triangles <span class="ital">LOC</span>, <span class="ital">RVF</span> respectively. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the base <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="ital">DEF</span>, so are the four prisms to the four prisms. </p>

<p>And similarly also, if we divde the remaining pyramids into two pyramids and into two prisms, then, as the base <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="ital">DEF</span>, so will all the prisms in the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCG</span> be to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <span class="ital">DEFH</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
<div id="elem.12.4.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>But that, as the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> is to the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span>, so is the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="ital">PMN</span> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="ital">STU</span> its opposite, we must prove as follows. </p>

       
<p>For in the same figure let perpendiculars be conceived drawn from <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> to the planes <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span>; these are of course equal because, by hypothesis, the pyramids are of equal height. </p>

       
<p>Now, since the two straight lines <span class="ital">GC</span> and the perpendicular from <span class="ital">G</span> are cut by the parallel planes <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">PMN</span>, they will be cut in the same ratios. [<a href="/elem.11.17">XI. 17</a>] <pb n="385"/></p>

       
<p>And <span class="ital">GC</span> is bisected by the plane <span class="ital">PMN</span> at <span class="ital">N</span>; therefore the perpendicular from <span class="ital">G</span> to the plane <span class="ital">ABC</span> will also be bisected by the plane <span class="ital">PMN</span>. </p>

       
<p>For the same reason the perpendicular from <span class="ital">H</span> to the plane <span class="ital">DEF</span> will also be bisected by the plane <span class="ital">STU</span>. </p>

       
<p>And the perpendiculars from <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> to the planes <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span> are equal; therefore the perpendiculars from the triangles <span class="ital">PMN</span>, <span class="ital">STU</span> to the planes <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">DEF</span> are also equal. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the prisms in which the triangles <span class="ital">LOC</span>, <span class="ital">RVF</span> are bases, and <span class="ital">PMN</span>, <span class="ital">STU</span> their opposites, are of equal height. </p>

       
<p>Hence also the parallelepipedal solids described from the said prisms are of equal height and are to one another as their bases; [<a href="/elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] therefore their halves, namely the said prisms, are to one another as the base <span class="ital">LOC</span> is to the base <span class="ital">RVF</span>.
