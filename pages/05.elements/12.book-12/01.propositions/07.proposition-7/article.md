       <hi rend="ital">Any prism which has a triangular base is divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Any prism which has a triangular base is divded into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be a prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is the base and <span class="ital">DEF</span> its opposite; I say that the prism <span class="ital">ABCDEF</span> is divded into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">EC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">ABED</span> is a parallelogram, and <span class="ital">BD</span> is its diameter, therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="ital">EBD</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">DEB</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex. [<a href="/elem.12.5">XII. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">DEB</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">EBC</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex; for they are contained by the same planes. </p>

<p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex is also equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">EBC</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">FCBE</span> is a parallelogram, and <span class="ital">CE</span> is its diameter, the triangle <span class="ital">CEF</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="ital">CBE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">BCE</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ECF</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex. [<a href="/elem.12.5">XII. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">BCE</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex; <pb n="395"/>therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">CEF</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex; therefore the prism <span class="ital">ABCDEF</span> has been divded into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases. </p>

<p>And, since the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">CAB</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex, for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">C</span> the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is the base and <span class="ital">DEF</span> its opposite, therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex is a third of the prism which has the same base, the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span>, and <span class="ital">DEF</span> as its opposite. </p>

       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
       
<p>From this it is manifest that any pyramid is a third part of the prism which has the same base with it and equal height. Q. E. D.</p>
