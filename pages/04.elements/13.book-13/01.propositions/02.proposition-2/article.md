<p><span class="ital">If the square on a straight line be five times the square on a segment of it</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>, <span class="ital">when the double of the said segment is cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">the greater segment is the remaining part of the original straight line.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the square on the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be five times the square on the segment <span class="ital">AC</span> of it, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be double of <span class="ital">AC</span>; I say that, when <span class="ital">CD</span> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is <span class="ital">CB</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let the squares <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">CG</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> respectively, let the figure in <span class="ital">AF</span> be drawn, and let <span class="ital">BE</span> be drawn through. </p>

<p>Now, since the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">AF</span> is five times <span class="ital">AH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">AH</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">DC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CA</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">DC</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>, that is, <span class="ital">CG</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">AH</span>. </p>

<p>But the gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span> was also proved quadruple of <span class="ital">AH</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CG</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">DC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CA</span>, while <span class="ital">DC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CK</span>, and <span class="ital">AC</span> to <span class="ital">CH</span>, therefore <span class="ital">KB</span> is also double of <span class="ital">BH</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] <pb n="444"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">HB</span> are also double of <span class="ital">HB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">KB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">HB</span>. </p>

<p>But the whole gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span> was also proved equal to the whole <span class="ital">CG</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">HF</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BG</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">BG</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, for <span class="ital">CD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DG</span>; and <span class="ital">HF</span> is the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">DC</span> is to <span class="ital">CB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CB</span> to <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DC</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CB</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, when the straight line <span class="ital">CD</span> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <span class="ital">CB</span> is the greater segment. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
<div id="elem.13.2.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p>That the double of <span class="ital">AC</span> is greater than <span class="ital">BC</span> is to be proved thus. </p>

       
<p>If not, let <span class="ital">BC</span> be, if possible, double of <span class="ital">CA</span>. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CA</span> are five times the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>. </p>

       
<p>But, by hypothesis, the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is also five times the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CA</span>: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>] </p>

       
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CB</span> is not double of <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

       
<p>Similarly we can prove that neither is a straight line less than <span class="ital">CB</span> double of <span class="ital">CA</span>; for the absurdity is much greater. </p>

       
<p>Therefore the double of <span class="ital">AC</span> is greater than <span class="ital">CB</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
