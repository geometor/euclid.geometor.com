<p><span class="ital">If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">the square on the greater segment added to the half of the whole is five times the square on the half.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point <span class="ital">C</span>, and let <span class="ital">AC</span> be the greater segment; let the straight line <span class="ital">AD</span> be produced in a straight line with <span class="ital">CA</span>, and let <span class="ital">AD</span> be made half of <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the squares <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span>, and let the figure in <span class="ital">DF</span> be drawn; let <span class="ital">FC</span> be carried through to <span class="ital">G</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.3">VI. Def. 3</a>, <a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CE</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">FH</span> the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FH</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BA</span> is double of <span class="ital">AD</span>, while <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal to <span class="ital">KA</span>, and <span class="ital">AD</span> to <span class="ital">AH</span>, therefore <span class="ital">KA</span> is also double of <span class="ital">AH</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">KA</span> is to <span class="ital">AH</span>, so is <span class="ital">CK</span> to <span class="ital">CH</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CK</span> is double of <span class="ital">CH</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">HC</span> are also double of <span class="ital">CH</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">KC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">HC</span>. <pb n="441"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CE</span> was also proved equal to <span class="ital">HF</span>; therefore the whole square <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span>. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">BA</span> is double of <span class="ital">AD</span>, the square on <span class="ital">BA</span> is quadruple of the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>, that is, <span class="ital">AE</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">DH</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="ital">MNO</span> is also quadruple of <span class="ital">AP</span>; therefore the whole <span class="ital">DF</span> is five times <span class="ital">AP</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DF</span> is the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, and <span class="ital">AP</span> the square on <span class="ital">DA</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">DA</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
