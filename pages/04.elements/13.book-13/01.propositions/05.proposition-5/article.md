<p><span class="ital">If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">and there be added to it a straight line equal to the greater segment</span>, <span class="ital">the whole straight line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="ital">and the original straight line is the greater segment.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point <span class="ital">C</span>, let <span class="ital">AC</span> be the greater segment, and let <span class="ital">AD</span> be equal to <span class="ital">AC</span>. 
      </p>

<p>I say that the straight line <span class="ital">DB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">A</span>, and the original straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> is the greater segment. </p>

<p>For let the square <span class="ital">AE</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let the figure be drawn. <pb n="449"/></p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.3 elem.6.17">VI. Def. 3</a>, VI. 17] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CE</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">CH</span> the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">HC</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">HE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">CE</span>, and <span class="ital">DH</span> is equal to <span class="ital">HC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DH</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">HE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the whole <span class="ital">DK</span> is equal to the whole <span class="ital">AE</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DK</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span>, for <span class="ital">AD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DL</span>; and <span class="ital">AE</span> is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">DA</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">DB</span> is to <span class="ital">BA</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">AD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">BA</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BA</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">AD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.14">V. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">AB</span> is the greater segment. Q. E. D.</p>
