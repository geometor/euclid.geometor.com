<p><span class="ital">To find two straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial and moreover incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them</span>. </p>

<p>Let there be set out two medial straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> commensurable in square only, containing a medial rectangle, and such that the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.32">X. 32</a>
, <span class="ital">ad fin</span>.] <pb n="81"/>let the semicircle <span class="ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let the rest of the construction be as above. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FB</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.18">X. 18</a>
] <span class="ital">AD</span> is also incommensurable in square with <span class="ital">DB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is medial, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>
, <a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>
] </p>

<p>And, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span> is equal to the square on each of the straight lines <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">DF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="ital">FD</span>, so that the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is also double of the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.32.p.1">X. 32, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And it is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.32.l.1">Lemma after X. 32</a>
] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, while <span class="ital">CB</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">BE</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BE</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>
] so that the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is also incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>
] and the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>; therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>. <pb n="82"/></p>

<p>Therefore two straight lines <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> incommensurable in square have been found which make the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial and moreover incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them.
