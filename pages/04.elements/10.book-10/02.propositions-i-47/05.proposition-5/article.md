<p><hi rend="ital">Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be commensurable magnitudes; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>

<p>Let it measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">D</span>; and, as many times as <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">D</span>, while the unit also measures <span class="ital">D</span> according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures the number <span class="ital">D</span> the same number of times as the magnitude <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is the unit to <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] therefore, inversely, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to the unit. [cf. <a href="/elem.5.7.p.1">V. 7, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">E</span>, while the unit also measures <span class="ital">E</span> according to the units in it, <pb n="25"/>therefore the unit measures <span class="ital">E</span> the same number of times as <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the unit to <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>But it was also proved that, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">C</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to the unit;</span> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the number <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the commensurable magnitudes <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the number <span class="ital">D</span> has to the number <span class="ital">E</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
