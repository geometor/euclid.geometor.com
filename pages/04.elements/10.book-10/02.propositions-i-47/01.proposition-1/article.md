<p><hi rend="ital">Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out</hi>. </p>

<p><span class="ital">Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB, C</span> be two unequal magnitudes of which <span class="ital">AB</span> is the greater: I say that, if from <span class="ital">AB</span> there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the magnitude <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For <span class="ital">C</span> if multiplied will sometime be greater than <span class="ital">AB</span>. [cf. <a href="/elem.5.def.4">v. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be multiplied, and let <span class="ital">DE</span> be a multiple of <span class="ital">C</span>, and greater than. <span class="ital">AB</span>; let <span class="ital">DE</span> be divded into the parts <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> equal to <span class="ital">C</span>, from <span class="ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted <span class="ital">BH</span> greater than its half, and, from <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> greater than its half, and let this process be repeated continually until the divsions in <span class="ital">AB</span> are equal in multitude with the divsions in <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Let, then, <span class="ital">AK</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">HB</span> be divsions which are equal in multitude with <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">DE</span> is greater than <span class="ital">AB</span>, and from <span class="ital">DE</span> there has been subtracted <span class="ital">EG</span> less than its half, and, from <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BH</span> greater than its half, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">GD</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="ital">HA</span>. <pb n="15"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">GD</span> is greater than <span class="ital">HA</span>, and there has been subtracted, from <span class="ital">GD</span>, the half <span class="ital">GF</span>, and, from <span class="ital">HA</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span> greater than its half, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">DF</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DF</span> is equal to <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">AK</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AK</span> is less than <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore there is left of the magnitude <span class="ital">AB</span> the magnitude <span class="ital">AK</span> which is less than the lesser magnitude set out, namely <span class="ital">C</span>. Q. E. D. </p>

<p>And the theorem can be similarly proved even if the parts subtracted be halves.</p>
