       <span class="ital">To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square only, containing a rational rectangle, and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with the greater.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be set out two rational straight lines <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> commensurable in square only and such that the square on <span class="ital">A</span>, being the greater, is greater than the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.29">X. 29</a>] 
      </p>

<p>And let the square on <span class="ital">C</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Now the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> is medial; [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">C</span> is also medial; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] <pb n="70"/></p>

<p>Let the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Now the square on <span class="ital">B</span> is rational; therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, while the square on <span class="ital">C</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">C</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But, as the square on <span class="ital">C</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span> in square only; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">D</span> in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">C</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23">X. 23</a>, addition] </p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, and the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">B</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">A</span>, therefore also the square on <span class="ital">C</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">D</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore two medial straight lines <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle, have been found, and the square on <span class="ital">C</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">D</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly also it can be proved that the square on <span class="ital">C</span> exceeds the square on <span class="ital">D</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>, when the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">B</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">A</span>.
