<p><span class="ital">If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called a</span>
       <span class="bold">second bimedial</span>
       <span class="ital">straight line</span>. <lb n="5"/></p>

<p>For let two medial straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle be added together;  I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>For let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span> be set out, and let the parallelogram <span class="ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span>, producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as breadth. [<a href="/elem.1.44">I. 44</a>
] <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>Then, since the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> and twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>
] let <span class="ital">EH</span>, equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, be applied to <span class="ital">DE</span>; <pb n="86"/>therefore the remainder <span class="ital">HF</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. <lb n="20"/></p>

<p>And, since each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also medial. </p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">EH</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <lb n="25"/>while <span class="ital">FH</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore each of the rectangle <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HF</span> is medial. </p>

<p>And they are applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DE</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>
] <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, and, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] <lb n="35"/></p>

<p>But the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>
] and twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>
] </p>

<p>Therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable<lb n="40"/> with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>
] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">EH</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">HF</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">HF</span>, so that <span class="ital">DH</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">HG</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>
, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] <lb n="45"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that <span class="ital">DG</span> is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>
] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DE</span> is rational; and the rectangle contained by an irrational and a rational <lb n="50"/>straight line is irrational; [cf. <a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>
] therefore the area <span class="ital">DF</span> is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>
] <pb n="87"/></p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AC</span> is the side of the square equal to <span class="ital">DF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. <lb n="55"/></p>

<p>And let it be called a <span class="bold">second bimedial</span> straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
