<p><hi rend="ital">The rectangle contained by medial straight lines commensurable in length is medial</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The rectangle contained by medial straight lines commensurable in length is medial</span>. </p>

<p>For let the rectangle <span class="ital">AC</span> be contained by the medial straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> which are commensurable in length; I say that <span class="ital">AC</span> is medial. </p>

<p>For on <span class="ital">AB</span> let the square <span class="ital">AD</span> be described; therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is medial. 
      </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, while <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">BD</span>, therefore <span class="ital">DB</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>; so that <span class="ital">DA</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DA</span> is medial; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
