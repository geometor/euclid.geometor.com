<p><hi rend="ital">The square on a medial straight line, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a straight line rational and incommensurable in length with that to which it is applied</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The square on a medial straight line, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a straight line rational and incommensurable in length with that to which it is applied</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be medial and <span class="ital">CB</span> rational, and let a rectangular area <span class="ital">BD</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span> be applied to <span class="ital">BC</span>, producing <span class="ital">CD</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CB</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is medial, the square on it is equal to a rectangular area contained by rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Let the square on it be equal to <span class="ital">GF</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on it is also equal to <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BD</span> is equal to <span class="ital">GF</span>. </p>

<p>But it is also equiangular with it; and in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; [<a href="/elem.6.14">VI. 14</a>] therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">BC</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="ital">EF</span> to <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">BC</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.22">VI. 22</a>] <pb n="52"/></p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">CB</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">EG</span>, for each of these straight lines is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is also commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is also rational; [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is rational. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EG</span>, for they are commensurable in square only, and, as <span class="ital">EF</span> is to <span class="ital">EG</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>, [Lemma] therefore the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">EF</span>, for the straight lines are rational in square; and the rectangle <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">FE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>, for they are equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is also incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CB</span>, so is <span class="ital">DC</span> to <span class="ital">CB</span>; [Lemma] therefore <span class="ital">DC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CB</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
