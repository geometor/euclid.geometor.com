<p><hi rend="ital">If two rational straight lines commensurable in square only be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called</hi>

<p><span class="ital">If two rational straight lines commensurable in square only be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called</span>
       <span class="bold">binomial</span>. </p>

<p>For let two rational straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> commensurable<lb n="5"/> in square only be added together;  I say that the whole <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>— <lb n="10"/>for they are commensurable in square only— and, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with the square on <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>
] <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>But twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>
], and the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">BC</span>—for <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only— [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>
] therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable <lb n="20"/>with the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>
] </p>

<p>And, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> [<a href="/elem.2.4">II. 4</a>
], is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>
] </p>

<p>But the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; <lb n="25"/>therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational, so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is also irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>
] </p>

<p>And let it be called <span class="bold">binomial</span>.<pb n="84"/></p>
