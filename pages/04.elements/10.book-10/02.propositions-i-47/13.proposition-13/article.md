<p><hi rend="ital">If two magnitudes be commensurable, and the one of them be incommensurable with any magnitude, the remaining one will also be incommensurable with the same</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two magnitudes be commensurable, and the one of them be incommensurable with any magnitude, the remaining one will also be incommensurable with the same</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two commensurable magnitudes, and let one of them, <span class="ital">A</span>, be incommensurable with any other magnitude <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that the remaining one, <span class="ital">B</span>, will also be incommensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">B</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>, while <span class="ital">A</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] </p>

<p>But it is also incommensurable with it: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is not commensurable with <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore it is incommensurable with it. </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
<div id="elem.10.13.l.1" class="lemma">
       <h1>LEMMA.</h1>
       
<p><span class="ital">Given two unequal straight lines, to find by what square the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less</span>. </p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> be the given two unequal straight lines, and let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the greater of them; thus it is required to find by what square the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">C</span>. 
       </p>

       
<p>Let the semicircle <span class="ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">AD</span> be fitted into it equal to <span class="ital">C</span>; [<a href="/elem.4.1">IV. 1</a>] let <span class="ital">DB</span> be joined. </p>

       
<p>It is then manifest that the angle <span class="ital">ADB</span> is right, [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] and that the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">AD</span>, that is, <span class="ital">C</span>, by the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] </p>

       
<p>Similarly also, if two straight lines be given, the straight line the square on which is equal to the sum of the squares on them is found in this manner. <pb n="37"/></p>

       
<p>Let <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> be the given two straight lines, and let it be required to find the straight line the square on which is equal to the sum of the squares on them. </p>

       
<p>Let them be placed so as to contain a right angle, that formed by <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>; and let <span class="ital">AB</span> be joined. </p>

       
<p>It is again manifest that the straight line the square on which is equal to the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
