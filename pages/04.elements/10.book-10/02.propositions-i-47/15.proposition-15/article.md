<p><hi rend="ital">If two commensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be commensurable with each of them; and, if the whole be commensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be commensurable</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two commensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be commensurable with each of them; and, if the whole be commensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be commensurable</span>. </p>

<p>For let the two commensurable magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be added together; I say that the whole <span class="ital">AC</span> is also commensurable with each of the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>

<p>Let it measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, it will also measure the whole <span class="ital">AC</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is commensurable with each of the magnitudes <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.def.1">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">AC</span> be commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also commensurable. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span> are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>

<p>Let it measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AB</span>, it will also measure the remainder <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>

<p>But it measures <span class="ital">AB</span> also; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> will measure <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable. [<a href="/elem.10.def.1">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.</p>
