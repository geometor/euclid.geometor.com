<p><span class="ital">If from a medial area a rational area be subtracted, there arise two other irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole</span>. </p>

<p>For from the medial area <span class="ital">BC</span> let the rational area <span class="ital">BD</span> be subtracted. <pb n="237"/></p>

<p>I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the remainder <span class="ital">EC</span> becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. 
      </p>

<p>For let a rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> be set out, and let the areas be similarly applied. </p>

<p>It follows then that <span class="ital">FH</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>, while <span class="ital">KF</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] therefore <span class="ital">KH</span> is an apotome, and <span class="ital">FK</span> the annex to it. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Now the square on <span class="ital">HF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">HF</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>

<p>If then the square on <span class="ital">HF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">HF</span>, while the annex <span class="ital">FK</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> set out, <span class="ital">KH</span> is a second apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.2">X. Deff. III. 2</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">FG</span> is rational; so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">LH</span>, that is, of <span class="ital">EC</span>, is a first apotome of a medial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.92">X. 92</a>] </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">HF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">HF</span>, while the annex <span class="ital">FK</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">FG</span> set out, <span class="ital">KH</span> is a fifth apotome; [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.5">X. Deff. III. 5</a>] so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of <span class="ital">EC</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [<a href="/elem.10.95">X. 95</a>]<pb n="238"/></p>
