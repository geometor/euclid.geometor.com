<p><hi rend="ital">The apotome is not the same with the binomial straight line</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">The apotome is not the same with the binomial straight line</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be an apotome; I say that <span class="ital">AB</span> is not the same with the binomial straight line. 
      </p>

<p>For, if possible, let it be so; let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DC</span> be set out, and to <span class="ital">CD</span> let there be applied the rectangle <span class="ital">CE</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="ital">DE</span> as breadth. </p>

<p>Then, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is an apotome, <span class="ital">DE</span> is a first apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.97">X. 97</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">EF</span> be the annex to it; therefore <span class="ital">DF</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="ital">DF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">FE</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">DF</span>, and <span class="ital">DF</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">DC</span> set out. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.1">X. Deff. III. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is binomial, therefore <span class="ital">DE</span> is a first binomial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.60">X. 60</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be divded into its terms at <span class="ital">G</span>, and let <span class="ital">DG</span> be the greater term; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, <pb n="241"/>the square on <span class="ital">DG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">GE</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">DG</span>, and the greater term <span class="ital">DG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">DC</span> set out. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">DF</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DG</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] therefore the remainder <span class="ital">GF</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">GF</span>, <span class="ital">FE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EG</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>But it is also rational: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore the apotome is not the same with the binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
