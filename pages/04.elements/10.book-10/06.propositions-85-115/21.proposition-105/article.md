<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable with a minor straight line is minor</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable with a minor straight line is minor</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be a minor straight line, and <span class="ital">CD</span> commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also minor. 
      </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before; then, since <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are incommensurable in square, [<a href="/elem.10.76">X. 76</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also incommensurable in square. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Now since, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>, [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>, <a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.22">VI. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, as the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are to the square on <span class="ital">EB</span>, so are the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> to the square on <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">BE</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">DF</span>; therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is also commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is rational; [<a href="/elem.10.76">X. 76</a>] therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also rational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] <pb n="233"/></p>

<p>Again, since, as the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is to the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>, while the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">CF</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is also commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>But the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is medial; [<a href="/elem.10.76">X. 76</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also medial; [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is minor. [<a href="/elem.10.76">X. 76</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
