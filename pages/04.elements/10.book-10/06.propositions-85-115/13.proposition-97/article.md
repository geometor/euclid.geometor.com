       <hi rend="ital">The square on an apotome applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a first apotome.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">The square on an apotome applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a first apotome.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be an apotome, and <span class="ital">CD</span> rational, and to <span class="ital">CD</span> let there be applied <span class="ital">CE</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="ital">CF</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="ital">CF</span> is a first apotome. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BG</span> be the annex to <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>To <span class="ital">CD</span> let there be applied <span class="ital">CH</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span>, and <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">BG</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore the whole <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and, in these, <span class="ital">CE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">FL</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">FM</span> be bisected at the point <span class="ital">N</span>, and let <span class="ital">NO</span> be drawn through <span class="ital">N</span> parallel to <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore each of the rectangles <span class="ital">FO</span>, <span class="ital">LN</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are rational, and <span class="ital">DM</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>,. therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is rational. </p>

<p>And it has been applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span>, producing <span class="ital">CM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is medial, and <span class="ital">FL</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">FL</span> is medial. <pb n="213"/></p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span>, producing <span class="ital">FM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">FM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are rational, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is medial, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">FL</span> to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DM</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">FL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">DM</span> is to <span class="ital">FL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CM</span> to <span class="ital">FM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">FM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is also a first apotome. </p>

<p>For, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> is a mean proportional between the squares on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">CH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">BG</span>, and <span class="ital">NL</span> equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">NL</span> is also a mean proportional between <span class="ital">CH</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">NL</span>, so is <span class="ital">NL</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">NL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CK</span> to <span class="ital">NM</span>, and, as <span class="ital">NL</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is <span class="ital">NM</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">CK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">NM</span> [<a href="/elem.6.17">VI. 17</a>], that is, to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">FM</span>. </p>

<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">GB</span>, <span class="ital">CH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">KL</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">CH</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is <span class="ital">CK</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">CK</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">MF</span> are two unequal straight lines, <pb n="214"/>and to <span class="ital">CM</span> there has been applied the rectangle <span class="ital">CK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="ital">FM</span> and deficient by a square figure, while <span class="ital">CK</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">KM</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">CM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">MF</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.17">X. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">CM</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="ital">CD</span> set out; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span> is a first apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.1">X. Deff. III. 1</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
