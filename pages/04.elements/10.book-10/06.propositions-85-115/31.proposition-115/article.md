<p><hi rend="ital">From a medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">From a medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be a medial straight line; I say that from <span class="ital">A</span> there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding. </p>

<p>Let a rational straight line <span class="ital">B</span> be set out,  and let the square on <span class="ital">C</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is irrational; [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] for that which is contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational. [deduction from <a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>And it is not the same with any of the preceding; for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a medial straight line. </p>

<p>Again, let the square on <span class="ital">D</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is irrational. [deduction from <a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is irrational; [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] and it is not the same with any of the preceding, for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line, produces <span class="ital">C</span> as breadth. </p>

<p>Similarly, if this arrangement proceeds <foreign lang="la">ad infinitum</foreign>, it is manifest that from the medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none is the same with any of the preceding. Q. E. D.<pb n="255"/></p>
