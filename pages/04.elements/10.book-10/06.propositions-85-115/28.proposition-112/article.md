<p><span class="ital">The square on a rational straight line applied to the binomial straight line produces as breadth an apotome the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the binomial and moreover in the same ratio; and further the apotome so arising will have the same order as the binomial straight line</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span> be a rational straight line, let <span class="ital">BC</span> be a binomial, and let <span class="ital">DC</span> be its greater term; let the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>;  I say that <span class="ital">EF</span> is an apotome the terms of which are commensurable with <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, and in the same ratio, and further <span class="ital">EF</span> will have the same order as <span class="ital">BC</span>. <pb n="244"/></p>

<p>For again let the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">G</span> be equal to the square on <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Since then the rectangle <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">BD</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">CB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.16">VI. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CB</span> is greater than <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">G</span> is also greater than <span class="ital">EF</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>, <a href="/elem.5.14">V. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">EH</span> be equal to <span class="ital">G</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">CB</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is <span class="ital">HE</span> to <span class="ital">EF</span>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, as <span class="ital">CD</span> is to <span class="ital">BD</span>, so is <span class="ital">HF</span> to <span class="ital">FE</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.17">V. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">HF</span> is to <span class="ital">FE</span>, so is <span class="ital">FK</span> to <span class="ital">KE</span>; therefore also the whole <span class="ital">HK</span> is to the whole <span class="ital">KF</span> as <span class="ital">FK</span> is to <span class="ital">KE</span>; for, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents. [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">FK</span> is to <span class="ital">KE</span>, so is <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">DB</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] therefore also, as <span class="ital">HK</span> is to <span class="ital">KF</span>, so is <span class="ital">CD</span> to <span class="ital">DB</span>. [id.] </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">DB</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> is also commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.22">VI. 22</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And, as the square on <span class="ital">HK</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>, so is <span class="ital">HK</span> to <span class="ital">KE</span>, since the three straight lines <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> are proportional. [<a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">KE</span>, so that <span class="ital">HE</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="ital">EK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span>, while the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is rational, therefore the rectangle <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">BD</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BD</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] so that <span class="ital">EK</span>, being commensurable with it, is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="ital">BD</span>. <pb n="245"/></p>

<p>Since, then, as <span class="ital">CD</span> is to <span class="ital">DB</span>, so is <span class="ital">FK</span> to <span class="ital">KE</span>, while <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> are straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">KE</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">FK</span> is also rational. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>Now the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">DB</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">CD</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>

<p>If then the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">DB</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">CD</span>, the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="ital">KE</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is <span class="ital">FK</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.11 elem.10.12">X. 11, 12</a>] if <span class="ital">BD</span> is so commensurable, so also is <span class="ital">KE</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] but, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> is so. </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">CD</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">DB</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">CD</span>, the square on <span class="ital">FK</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="ital">KE</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">FK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">CD</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, so also is <span class="ital">FK</span>; if <span class="ital">BD</span> is so commensurable, so also is <span class="ital">KE</span>; <pb n="246"/>but, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> is so; so that <span class="ital">FE</span> is an apotome, the terms of which <span class="ital">FK</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> are commensurable with the terms <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> of the binomial straight line and in the same ratio, and it has the same order as <span class="ital">BC</span>.
