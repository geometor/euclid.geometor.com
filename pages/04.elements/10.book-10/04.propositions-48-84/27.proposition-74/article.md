<p><span class="ital">If from a medial straight line there be subtracted a medial straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square only, and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle, the remainder is irrational. And let it be called a</span>
       <span class="bold">first apotome of a medial</span>
       <span class="ital">straight line</span>. <pb n="160"/></p>

<p>For from the medial straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the medial straight line <span class="ital">BC</span> which is commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span> in square only and with <span class="ital">AB</span> makes the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> rational;  I say that the remainder <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational; and let it be called a <span class="bold">first apotome of a medial</span> straight line. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are medial, the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also medial. </p>

<p>But twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, [Cf. <a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] since, if the whole is incommensurable with one of the magnitudes, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable. [<a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And let it be called a <span class="bold">first apotome of a medial</span> straight line.</p>
