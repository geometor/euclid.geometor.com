<p>
       <span class="ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area is the irrational straight line which is called a first bimedial.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the area <span class="ital">ABCD</span> be contained by the rational <lb n="5"/>straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> and the second binomial <span class="ital">AD</span>; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC</span> is a first bimedial straight line. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AD</span> is a second binomial straight line, let it be divded into its terms at <span class="ital">E</span>, so that <span class="ital">AE</span> is the greater term; <lb n="10"/>therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, and the lesser term <span class="ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.2">X. Deff. II. 2</a>] <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ED</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">F</span>, <pb n="121"/>and let there be applied to <span class="ital">AE</span> the rectangle <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> equal to the square on <span class="ital">EF</span> and deficient by a square figure; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">GE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.17">X. 17</a>] </p>

<p>Through <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> let <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">FL</span> be drawn parallel to <lb n="20"/><span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, let the square <span class="ital">SN</span> be constructed equal to the parallelogram <span class="ital">AH</span>, and the square <span class="ital">NQ</span> equal to <span class="ital">GK</span>, and let them be placed so that <span class="ital">MN</span> is in a straight line with <span class="ital">NO</span>; <lb n="25"/>therefore <span class="ital">RN</span> is also in a straight line with <span class="ital">NP</span>. 
      </p>

<p>Let the square <span class="ital">SQ</span> be completed. </p>

<p>It is then manifest from what was proved before that <span class="ital">MR</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span> and is equal to <span class="ital">EL</span>, and that <span class="ital">MO</span> is the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <span class="ital">AC</span>. <lb n="30"/></p>

<p>It is now to be proved that <span class="ital">MO</span> is a first bimedial straight line. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">ED</span>, while <span class="ital">ED</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">EG</span>, <lb n="35"/><span class="ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are also incommensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AG</span> and <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are pairs of rational <lb n="40"/>straight lines commensurable in square only; so that each of the rectangles <span class="ital">AH</span>, <span class="ital">GK</span> is medial. [<a href="/elem.10.21">X. 21</a>] </p>

<p>Hence each of the squares <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NQ</span> is medial. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are also medial. </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">GE</span>, <lb n="45"/><span class="ital">AH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">GK</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>. <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] that is, <span class="ital">SN</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">NQ</span>, that is, the square on <span class="ital">MN</span> with the square on <span class="ital">NO</span>. <pb n="122"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">ED</span>, while <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">AG</span>, <lb n="50"/>and <span class="ital">ED</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">EF</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] so that <span class="ital">AH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="ital">SN</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">MR</span>, that is, <span class="ital">PN</span> with <span class="ital">NR</span>, [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] <lb n="55"/>that is, <span class="ital">MN</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> were proved to be both medial and commensurable in square; therefore <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. <lb n="60"/></p>

<p>I say next that they also contain a rational rectangle. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">DE</span> is, by hypothesis, commensurable with each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EF</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">EK</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] </p>

<p>And each of them is rational; <lb n="65"/>therefore <span class="ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="ital">MR</span> is rational, [<a href="/elem.10.19">X. 19</a>] and <span class="ital">MR</span> is the rectangle <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>. </p>

<p>But, if two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational and is called a first bimedial straight line. [<a href="/elem.10.37">X. 37</a>] <lb n="70"/></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">MO</span> is a first bimedial straight line. Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="39" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">39. <lemma from="ROOT" to="DITTO">Therefore <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AG</span> and <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are pairs of rational straight lines commensurable in square only.</lemma> The text has <quote>Therefore <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only,</quote>
 which I have altered because it would naturally convey the impression that <span class="ital">any two</span> of the three straight lines are commensurable in square only, whereas <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> are commensurable in length (<a href="/elem.1.18">I. 18</a>), and it is only the other two pairs which are commensurable in square only.</blockquote></p>
