<p><span class="ital">If from a rational straight line there be subtracted a rational straight line commensurable with the whole in square only, the remainder is irrational; and let it be called</span>
       <span class="bold">an apotome</span>. </p>

<p>For from the rational straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> let the rational straight line <span class="ital">BC</span>, commensurable with the whole in square only, be subtracted;  I say that the remainder <span class="ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called <span class="bold">apotome</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>, and, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] and twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] <pb n="159"/></p>

<p>And, inasmuch as the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="ital">CA</span>, [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13 elem.10.16">X. 13, 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are rational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. [<a href="/elem.10.def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] </p>

<p>And let it be called an <span class="bold">apotome</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
