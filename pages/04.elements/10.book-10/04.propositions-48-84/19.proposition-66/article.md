<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be binomial, and let <span class="ital">CD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="ital">AB</span>;  I say that <span class="ital">CD</span> is binomial and the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is binomial, let it be divded into its terms at <span class="ital">E</span>, and let <span class="ital">AE</span> be the greater term; <pb n="146"/>therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be contrived that, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>] therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">EB</span> is to the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.19">V. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>, and <span class="ital">EB</span> with <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are rational; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also rational. </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">EB</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, alternately, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="ital">CF</span> to <span class="ital">FD</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.16">V. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And they are rational; therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.36">X. 36</a>] </p>

<p>I say next that it is the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>

<p>For the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EB</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>

<p>If then the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EB</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> will also be greater than the square on <span class="ital">FD</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <span class="ital">CF</span> will also be commensurable with it, [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] and for this reason each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> is a first binomial, that is, the same in order. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>

<p>But, if <span class="ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also commensurable with it, [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] and for this reason again <span class="ital">CD</span> will be the same in order with <span class="ital">AB</span>, for each of them will be a second binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.2">X. Deff. II. 2</a>] <pb n="147"/></p>

<p>But, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> will be commensurable with it, [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> is a third binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.3">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] </p>

<p>But, if the square on <span class="ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">EB</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">AE</span>, the square on <span class="ital">CF</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="ital">FD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">CF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.14">X. 14</a>] </p>

<p>And, if <span class="ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <span class="ital">CF</span> is also commensurable with it, and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> is a fourth binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.4">X. Deff. II. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But, if <span class="ital">EB</span> is so commensurable, so is <span class="ital">FD</span> also, and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> will be a fifth binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.5">X. Deff. II. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But, if neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> will be a sixth binomial. [<a href="/elem.10.def.2.6">X. Deff. II. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order. Q. E. D.</p>
