<p><span class="ital">If from a straight line there be subtracted a straight line which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which with the whole makes the squares on them added together rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial, the remainder is irrational; and let it be called</span>
       <span class="bold">minor</span>. </p>

<p>For from the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the straight line <span class="ital">BC</span> which is incommensurable in square with the whole and fulfils the given conditions. [<a href="/elem.10.33">X. 33</a>] 
      </p>

<p>I say that the remainder <span class="ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called <span class="bold">minor</span>. </p>

<p>For, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is <span class="bold">rational</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; and, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with the remainder, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>, <a href="/elem.10.16">X. 16</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>And let it be called <span class="bold">minor</span>.<pb n="164"/></p>
