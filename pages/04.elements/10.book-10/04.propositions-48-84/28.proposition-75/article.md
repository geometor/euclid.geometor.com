<p><span class="ital">If from a medial straight line there be subtracted a medial straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square only, and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle, the remainder is irrational; and let it be called a</span>
       <span class="bold">second apotome of a medial</span>
       <span class="ital">straight line</span>. </p>

<p>For from the medial straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the medial straight line <span class="ital">CB</span> which is commensurable with the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> in square only and such that the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, which it contains with the whole <span class="ital">AB</span>, is medial; [<a href="/elem.10.28">X. 28</a>] I say that the remainder <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational; and let it <span class="bold">be called a second apotome of a medial</span> straight line. 
      </p>

<p>For let a rational straight line <span class="ital">DI</span> be set out, let <span class="ital">DE</span> equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be applied to <span class="ital">DI</span>, producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as breadth, and let <span class="ital">DH</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> be applied to <span class="ital">DI</span>, producing <span class="ital">DF</span> as breadth; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">FE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7">II. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are medial and commensurable, therefore <span class="ital">DE</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 15 and 23, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DI</span>, producing <span class="ital">DG</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">DG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DI</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>Again, since the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is also medial. [<a href="/elem.10.23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] <pb n="162"/></p>

<p>And it is equal to <span class="ital">DH</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DH</span> is also medial. </p>

<p>And it has been applied to the rational straight line <span class="ital">DI</span>, producing <span class="ital">DF</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="ital">DF</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">DI</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.22">X. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is also incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>But the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are commensurable with the square on <span class="ital">AB</span>, [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] and twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is commensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] therefore twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.13">X. 13</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DE</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, and <span class="ital">DH</span> to twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="ital">DE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">DH</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">DE</span> is to <span class="ital">DH</span>, so is <span class="ital">GD</span> to <span class="ital">DF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="ital">GD</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

<p>And both are rational; therefore <span class="ital">GD</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is an apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">DI</span> is rational, and the rectangle contained by a rational and an irrational straight line is irrational, [deduction from <a href="/elem.10.20">X. 20</a>] and its ’side’ is irrational. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AC</span> is the ’side’ of <span class="ital">FE</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>And let it be called <span class="bold">a second apotome of a medial</span> straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
