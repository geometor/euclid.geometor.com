<p><span class="ital">If from a straight line there be subtracted a straight line which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and which with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial, but twice the rectangle contained by them rational, the remainder is irrational: and let it be called</span>
       <span class="bold">that which produces with a rational area a medial whole</span>. </p>

<p>For from the straight line <span class="ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the straight line <span class="ital">BC</span> which is incommensurable in square with <span class="ital">AB</span> and fulfils the given conditions; [<a href="/elem.10.34">X. 34</a>] I say that the remainder <span class="ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line aforesaid. </p>

<p>For, since the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is medial, while twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational, therefore the squares on <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>; therefore the remainder also, the square on <span class="ital">AC</span>, is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>. [<a href="/elem.2.7 elem.10.16">II. 7</a>, X. 16] 
      </p>

<p>And twice the rectangle <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>

<p>And let it be called <span class="bold">that which produces with a rational area a medial whole</span>. Q. E. D.<pb n="165"/></p>
