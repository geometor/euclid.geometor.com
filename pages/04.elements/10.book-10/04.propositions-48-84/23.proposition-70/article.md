<p><hi rend="ital">A straight line commensurable with the side of the sum of two medial areas is the side of the sum of two medial areas</hi>. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">A straight line commensurable with the side of the sum of two medial areas is the side of the sum of two medial areas</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be the side of the sum of two medial areas, and <span class="ital">CD</span> commensurable with <span class="ital">AB</span>; it is to be proved that <span class="ital">CD</span> is also the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas,  let it be divded into its straight lines at <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and furthermore the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.41">X. 41</a>] </p>

<p>Let the same construction be made as before. </p>

<p>We can then prove similarly that <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> are also incommensurable in square, the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>; so that the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is also medial, the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is medial, and moreover the sum of the squares on <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FD</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">CD</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas. Q. E. D.</p>
