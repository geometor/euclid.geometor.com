       <hi rend="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be set out continuously in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last make some number, the product will be perfect.</hi>

<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be set out continuously in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last make some number, the product will be perfect.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, beginning from an unit be set out in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes prime, let <span class="ital">E</span> be equal to the sum, and let <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> make <span class="ital">FG</span>; I say that <span class="ital">FG</span> is perfect. </p>

<p>For, however many <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in multitude, let so many <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> be taken in double proportion beginning from <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">M</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>] <pb n="422"/></p>

<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And the product of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> is also <span class="ital">FG</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">M</span> has made <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="ital">M</span> measures <span class="ital">FG</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">A</span> is a dyad; therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is double of <span class="ital">M</span>. 
      </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are continuously double of each other; therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> are continuously proportional in double proportion. </p>

<p>Now let there be subtracted from the second <span class="ital">HK</span> and the last <span class="ital">FG</span> the numbers <span class="ital">HN</span>, <span class="ital">FO</span>, each equal to the first <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore, as the excess of the second is to the first, so is the excess of the last to all those before it. [<a href="/elem.9.35">IX. 35</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">NK</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">OG</span> to <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">NK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="ital">OG</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">FO</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">E</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> and the unit. </p>

<p>Therefore the whole <span class="ital">FG</span> is equal to <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> and <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> and the unit; and it is measured by them. </p>

<p>I say also that <span class="ital">FG</span> will not be measured by any other number except <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> and the unit. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let some number <span class="ital">P</span> measure <span class="ital">FG</span>, and let <span class="ital">P</span> not be the same with any of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>. </p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">P</span> measures <span class="ital">FG</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">Q</span>; therefore <span class="ital">Q</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">P</span> has made <span class="ital">FG</span>. <pb n="423"/></p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">E</span> has also by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> made <span class="ital">FG</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">Q</span>, so is <span class="ital">P</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are continuously proportional beginning from an unit, therefore <span class="ital">D</span> will not be measured by any other number except <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.9.13">IX. 13</a>] </p>

<p>And, by hypothesis, <span class="ital">P</span> is not the same with any of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">P</span> will not measure <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">P</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">Q</span>; therefore neither does <span class="ital">E</span> measure <span class="ital">Q</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">E</span> is prime; and any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure. [<a href="/elem.7.29">VII. 29</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span> are prime to one another. </p>

<p>But primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] and, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">Q</span>, so is <span class="ital">P</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> measures <span class="ital">P</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">Q</span> measures <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span> is not measured by any other number except <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">Q</span> is the same with one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Let it be the same with <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>And, however many <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in multitude, let so many <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> be taken beginning from <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <span class="ital">B</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.14">VII. 14</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">P</span> is also equal to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">Q</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">L</span> to <span class="ital">P</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">Q</span> is the same with <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">L</span> is also the same with <span class="ital">P</span>; <pb n="424"/>which is impossible, for by hypothesis <span class="ital">P</span> is not the same with any of the numbers set out. </p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure <span class="ital">FG</span> except <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> and the unit. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">FG</span> was proved equal to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span> and the unit; and a perfect number is that which is equal to its own parts; [<a href="/elem.7.def.22">VII. Def. 22</a>] therefore <span class="ital">FG</span> is perfect. Q. E. D.</p>
