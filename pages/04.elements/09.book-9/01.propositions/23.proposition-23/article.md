       <hi rend="ital">If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be odd, the whole will also be odd.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be odd, the whole will also be odd.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let as many odd numbers as we please, <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, the multitude of which is odd, be added together; I say that the whole <span class="ital">AD</span> is also odd. 
      </p>

<p>Let the unit <span class="ital">DE</span> be subtracted from <span class="ital">CD</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="ital">CE</span> is even. [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">CA</span> is also even; [<a href="/elem.9.22">IX. 22</a>] therefore the whole <span class="ital">AE</span> is also even. [<a href="/elem.9.21">IX. 21</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">DE</span> is an unit. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is odd. [<a href="/elem.7.def.7">VII. Def. 7</a>] Q. E. D.
<blockquote n="3" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">3. Literally <quote>let there be as many numbers as we please, of which <span class="ital">let</span> the multitude <span class="ital">be</span> odd.</quote>
 This form, natural in Greek, is awkward in English.</blockquote></p>
