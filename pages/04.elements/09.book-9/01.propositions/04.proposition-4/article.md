       <hi rend="ital">If a cube number by multiplying a cube number make some number, the product will be cube.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a cube number by multiplying a cube number make some number, the product will be cube.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the cube number <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying the cube number <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span> is cube. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is cube. [<a href="/elem.9.3">IX. 3</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">D</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span> therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are cube numbers, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar solid numbers. </p>

<p>Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; [<a href="/elem.8.19">VIII. 19</a>] so that two mean proportional numbers will fall between <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> also. [<a href="/elem.8.8">VIII. 8</a>] </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">D</span> is cube; therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is also cube [<a href="/elem.8.23">VIII. 23</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
