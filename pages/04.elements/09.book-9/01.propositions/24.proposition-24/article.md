===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If from an even number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be even.</span>
      </p>

<p>For from the even number <span class="ital">AB</span> let the even number <span class="ital">BC</span> be subtracted: I say that the remainder <span class="ital">CA</span> is even. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">AB</span> is even, it has a half part. [<a href="/elem.7.def.6">VII. Def. 6</a>] <pb n="415"/></p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">BC</span> also has a half part; so that the remainder [<span class="ital">CA</span> also has a half part, and] <span class="ital">AC</span> is therefore even. Q. E. D.</p>
