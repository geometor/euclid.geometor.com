===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Given two numbers, to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be the given two numbers, and let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are either prime to one another or not. </p>

<p>And, if they are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a third proportional to them. [<a href="/elem.9.16">IX. 16</a>] <pb n="408"/></p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> not be prime to one another, and let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Then <span class="ital">A</span> either measures <span class="ital">C</span> or does not measure it. 
      </p>

<p>First, let it measure it according to <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>But, further, <span class="ital">B</span> has also by multiplying itself made <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] therefore a third proportional number <span class="ital">D</span> has been found to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span> not measure <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that it is impossible to find a third proportional number to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, let <span class="ital">D</span>, such third proportional, have been found. </p>

<p>Therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>But the square on <span class="ital">B</span> is <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is equal to <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Hence <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> according to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>But, by hypothesis, it also does not measure it: which is absurd. </p>

<p>Therefore it is not possible to find a third proportional number to <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> when <span class="ital">A</span> does not measure <span class="ital">C</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
