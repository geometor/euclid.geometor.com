<p><emph>On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side</em>. </p>

<p>For, if possible, on the same straight line <em>AB</em> let two similar and unequal segments of circles <em>ACB</em>, <em>ADB</em> be constructed on the same side;  let <em>ACD</em> be drawn through, and let <em>CB</em>, <em>DB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since the segment <em>ACB</em> is similar to the segment <em>ADB</em>, <pb n="53"/>and similar segments of circles are those which admit equal angles, [<a href="/elem.3.def.11">III. Def. 11</a>] <span class="center">the angle <em>ACB</em> is equal to the angle <em>ADB</em>, the exterior to the interior: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.1.16">I. 16</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
