<p><emph>On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line, and the angle at <em>C</em> the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line <em>AB</em> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. 
      </p>

<p>The angle at <em>C</em> is then acute, or right, or obtuse. </p>

<p>First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the point <em>A</em>, let the angle <em>BAD</em> be constructed equal to the angle at <em>C</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAD</em> is also acute.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <em>AE</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>DA</em>, let <em>AB</em> be <pb n="68"/>bisected at <em>F</em>, let <em>FG</em> be drawn from the point <em>F</em> at right angles to <em>AB</em>, and let <em>GB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AF</em> is equal to <em>FB</em>, and <em>FG</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>AF</em>, <em>FG</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BF</em>, <em>FG</em>;</span> and the angle <em>AFG</em> is equal to the angle <em>BFG</em>; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>AG</em> is equal to the base <em>BG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <em>G</em> and distance <em>GA</em> will pass through <em>B</em> also. </p>

<p>Let it be drawn, and let it be <em>ABE</em>; let <em>EB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since <em>AD</em> is drawn from <em>A</em>, the extremity of the diameter <em>AE</em>, at right angles to <em>AE</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>AD</em> touches the circle <em>ABE</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Since then a straight line <em>AD</em> touches the circle <em>ABE</em>, and from the point of contact at <em>A</em> a straight line <em>AB</em> is drawn across in the circle <em>ABE</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>DAB</em> is equal to the angle <em>AEB</em> in the alternate segment of the circle. [<a href="/elem.3.32">III. 32</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>DAB</em> is equal to the angle at <em>C</em>; therefore the angle at <em>C</em> is also equal to the angle <em>AEB</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore on the given straight line <em>AB</em> the segment <em>AEB</em> of a circle has been described admitting the angle <em>AEB</em> equal to the given angle, the angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Next let the angle at <em>C</em> be right;  and let it be again required to describe on <em>AB</em> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Let the angle <em>BAD</em> be constructed equal to the right angle at <em>C</em>, as is the case in the second figure; <pb n="69"/>let <em>AB</em> be bisected at <em>F</em>, and with centre <em>F</em> and distance either <em>FA</em> or <em>FB</em> let the circle <em>AEB</em> be described. </p>

<p>Therefore the straight line <em>AD</em> touches the circle <em>ABE</em>, because the angle at <em>A</em> is right. [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And the angle <em>BAD</em> is equal to the angle in the segment <em>AEB</em>, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <em>BAD</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>AEB</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore again the segment <em>AEB</em> of a circle has been described on <em>AB</em> admitting an angle equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Next, let the angle at <em>C</em> be obtuse;  and on the straight line <em>AB</em>, and at the point <em>A</em>, let the angle <em>BAD</em> be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let <em>AE</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>AD</em>, let <em>AB</em> be again bisected at <em>F</em>, let <em>FG</em> be drawn at right angles to <em>AB</em>, and let <em>GB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AF</em> is again equal to <em>FB</em>, and <em>FG</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>AF</em>, <em>FG</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BF</em>, <em>FG</em>;</span> and the angle <em>AFG</em> is equal to the angle <em>BFG</em>; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>AG</em> is equal to the base <em>BG</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <em>G</em> and distance <em>GA</em> will pass through <em>B</em> also; let it so pass, as <em>AEB</em>. </p>

<p>Now, since <em>AD</em> is drawn at right angles to the diameter <em>AE</em> from its extremity, <span class="center"><em>AD</em> touches the circle <em>AEB</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>And <em>AB</em> has been drawn across from the point of contact at <em>A</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAD</em> is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment <em>AHB</em> of the circle. [<a href="/elem.3.32">III. 32</a>]</span>
       <pb n="70"/></p>

<p>But the angle <em>BAD</em> is equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore the angle in the segment <em>AHB</em> is also equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore on the given straight line <em>AB</em> the segment <em>AHB</em> of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at <em>C</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
