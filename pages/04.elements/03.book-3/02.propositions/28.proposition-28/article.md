<p><emph>In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences</emph>, <emph>the greater equal to the greater and the less to the less</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences</em>, <em>the greater equal to the greater and the less to the less</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> be equal circles, and in the circles let <em>AB</em>, <em>DE</em> be equal straight lines cutting off <em>ACB</em>, <em>DFE</em> as greater circumferences and <em>AGB</em>, <em>DHE</em> as lesser; I say that the greater circumference <em>ACB</em> is equal to the greater circumference <em>DFE</em>, and the less circumference <em>AGB</em> to <em>DHE</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let the centres <em>K</em>, <em>L</em> of the circles be taken, and let <em>AK</em>, <em>KB</em>, <em>DL</em>, <em>LE</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since the circles are equal, <span class="center">the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides <em>AK</em>, <em>KB</em> are equal to the two sides <em>DL</em>, <em>LE</em>;</span> and the base <em>AB</em> is equal to the base <em>DE</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>AKB</em> is equal to the angle <em>DLE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [<a href="/elem.3.26">III. 26</a>] <span class="center">therefore the circumference <em>AGB</em> is equal to <em>DHE</em>.</span>
       <pb n="60"/></p>

<p>And the whole circle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the whole circle <em>DEF</em>; therefore the circumference <em>ACB</em> which remains is also equal to the circumference <em>DFE</em> which remains. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
