<p><emph>In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences</emph>, <emph>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</emph>. <pb n="57"/></p>

===

<p><em>In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences</em>, <em>whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</em>. <pb n="57"/></p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> be equal circles, and in them let there be equal angles, namely at the centres the angles <em>BGC</em>, <em>EHF</em>, and at the circumferences the angles <em>BAC</em>, <em>EDF</em>; I say that the circumference <em>BKC</em> is equal to the circumference <em>ELF</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <em>BC</em>, <em>EF</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since the circles <em>ABC</em>, <em>DEF</em> are equal, <span class="center">the radii are equal.</span>
      </p>

<p>Thus the two straight lines <em>BG</em>, <em>GC</em> are equal to the two straight lines <em>EH</em>, <em>HF</em>; <span class="center">and the angle at <em>G</em> is equal to the angle at <em>H</em>; therefore the base <em>BC</em> is equal to the base <em>EF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since the angle at <em>A</em> is equal to the angle at <em>D</em>, <span class="center">the segment <em>BAC</em> is similar to the segment <em>EDF</em>; [<a href="/elem.3.def.11">III. Def. 11</a>]</span> and they are upon equal straight lines. </p>

<p>But similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another; [<a href="/elem.3.24">III. 24</a>] <span class="center">therefore the segment <em>BAC</em> is equal to <em>EDF</em>.</span> But the whole circle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the whole circle <em>DEF</em>; therefore the circumference <em>BKC</em> which remains is equal to the circumference <em>ELF</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
