<p><emph>To bisect a given circumference</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>To bisect a given circumference</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ADB</em> be the given circumference; thus it is required to bisect the circumference <em>ADB</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be joined and bisected at <em>C</em>; from the point <em>C</em> let <em>CD</em> be drawn at right angles to the straight line <em>AB</em>,  and let <em>AD</em>, <em>DB</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since <em>AC</em> is equal to <em>CB</em>, and <em>CD</em> is common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>AC</em>, <em>CD</em> are equal to the two sides <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>;</span> and the angle <em>ACD</em> is equal to the angle <em>BCD</em>, for each is right; <span class="center">therefore the base <em>AD</em> is equal to the base <em>DB</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; [<a href="/elem.3.28">III. 28</a>] <span class="center">and each of the circumferences <em>AD</em>, <em>DB</em> is less than a semicircle; therefore the circumference <em>AD</em> is equal to the circumference <em>DB</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at the point <em>D</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
