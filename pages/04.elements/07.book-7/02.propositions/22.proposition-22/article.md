       <hi rend="ital">The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them are prime to one another.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them are prime to one another.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. 
      </p>

<p>For, if they are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. </p>

<p>Let some number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">C</span>. <pb n="324"/></p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">D</span>, and, as many times as <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">E</span>
      </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason also <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Thus the number <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying the two numbers <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, being less than they: which is impossible. </p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
