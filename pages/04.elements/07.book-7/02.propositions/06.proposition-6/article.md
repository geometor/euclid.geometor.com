       <hi rend="ital">If a number be parts of a number, and another be the same parts of another, the sum will also be the same parts of the sum that the one is of the one.</hi>
      </p>

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number be parts of a number, and another be the same parts of another, the sum will also be the same parts of the sum that the one is of the one.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">AB</span> be parts of the number <span class="ital">C</span>, and another, <span class="ital">DE</span>, the same parts of another, <span class="ital">F</span>, that <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that the sum of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is also the same parts of the sum of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> that <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For since, whatever parts <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> is also the same parts of <span class="ital">F</span>, therefore, as many parts of <span class="ital">C</span> as there are in <span class="ital">AB</span>, so many parts of <span class="ital">F</span> are there also in <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be divded into the parts of <span class="ital">C</span>, namely <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">DE</span> into the parts of <span class="ital">F</span>, namely <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span>; thus the multitude of <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span>. </p>

<p>And since, whatever part <span class="ital">AG</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same part is <span class="ital">DH</span> of <span class="ital">F</span> also, therefore, whatever part <span class="ital">AG</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same part also is the sum of <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">DH</span> of the sum of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.5">VII. 5</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason, whatever part <span class="ital">GB</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same part also is the sum of <span class="ital">GB</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span> of the sum of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, whatever parts <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same parts also is the sum of <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">DE</span> of the sum of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
