       <hi rend="ital">If, as whole is to whole, so is a number subtracted to a number subtracted, the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If, as whole is to whole, so is a number subtracted to a number subtracted, the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole.</span>
      </p>

<p>As the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> is to the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>, so let <span class="ital">AE</span> subtracted be to <span class="ital">CF</span> subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="ital">EB</span> is also to the remainder <span class="ital">FD</span> as the whole <span class="ital">AB</span> to the whole <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>Since, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">AE</span> of <span class="ital">CF</span> also; [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Therefore also the remainder <span class="ital">EB</span> is the same part or parts of <span class="ital">FD</span> that <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.7 elem.7.8">VII. 7, 8</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">EB</span> is to <span class="ital">FD</span>, so is <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
