<p>
       <span class="ital">If two numbers by multiplying one another make some number, and any prime number measure the product, it will also measure one of the original numbers.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying one another make <span class="ital">C</span>, and let any prime number <span class="ital">D</span> measure <span class="ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="ital">D</span> measures one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let it not measure <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Now <span class="ital">D</span> is prime; therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.7.29">VII. 29</a>] </p>

<p>And, as many times as <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="ital">E</span>. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>

<p>Further, <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has also made <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>But <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">A</span> are prime to one another, primes are also least, [<a href="/elem.7.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/elem.7.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Similarly we can also show that, if <span class="ital">D</span> do not measure <span class="ital">B</span>, it will measure <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures one of the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. Q. E. D.<pb n="332"/></p>
