<p><hi rend="ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, and each by multiplying itself make a certain number, the products will be prime to one another; and, if the original numbers by multiplying the products make certain numbers, the latter will also be prime to one another</hi> [<hi rend="ital">and this is always the case with the extremes</hi>]. </p>

===

<p><span class="ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, and each by multiplying itself make a certain number, the products will be prime to one another; and, if the original numbers by multiplying the products make certain numbers, the latter will also be prime to one another</span> [<span class="ital">and this is always the case with the extremes</span>]. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two numbers prime to one another, let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">C</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> make <span class="ital">D</span>, and let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="ital">E</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">E</span> make <span class="ital">F</span>; I say that both <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> and <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are prime to one another. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another, and <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. [<a href="/elem.7.25">VII. 25</a>] </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another, and <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are prime to one another. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another, and <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are prime to one another. [<span class="ital">id</span>.] </p>

<p>Since then the two numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> are prime to the two numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, both to each, therefore also the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is prime to the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.26">VII. 26</a>] </p>

<p>And the product of <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> is <span class="ital">D</span>, and the product of <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is <span class="ital">F</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
