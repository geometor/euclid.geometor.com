       <hi rend="ital">If a number be parts of a number, and another be the same parts of another, alternately also, whatever parts or part the first is of the third, the same parts or the same part will the second also be of the fourth.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If a number be parts of a number, and another be the same parts of another, alternately also, whatever parts or part the first is of the third, the same parts or the same part will the second also be of the fourth.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the number <span class="ital">AB</span> be parts of the number <span class="ital">C</span>, and another, <span class="ital">DE</span>, the same parts of another, <span class="ital">F</span>; I say that, alternately also, whatever parts or part <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">DE</span>, the same parts or the same part is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">F</span> also. 
      </p>

<p>For since, whatever parts <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same parts also is <span class="ital">DE</span> of <span class="ital">F</span>, therefore, as many parts of <span class="ital">C</span> as there are in <span class="ital">AB</span>, so many parts also of <span class="ital">F</span> are there in <span class="ital">DE</span>. </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span> be divded into the parts of <span class="ital">C</span>, namely <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span>, and <span class="ital">DE</span> into the parts of <span class="ital">F</span>, namely <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span>; thus the multitude of <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">GB</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">DH</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span>. </p>

<p>Now since, whatever part <span class="ital">AG</span> is of <span class="ital">C</span>, the same part also is <span class="ital">DH</span> of <span class="ital">F</span>, alternately also, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">AG</span> is of <span class="ital">DH</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">F</span> also. [<a href="/elem.7.9">VII. 9</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason also, whatever part or parts <span class="ital">GB</span> is of <span class="ital">HE</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">F</span> also; <pb n="311"/>so that, in addition, whatever parts or part <span class="ital">AB</span> is of <span class="ital">DE</span>, the same parts also, or the same part, is <span class="ital">C</span> of <span class="ital">F</span>.
