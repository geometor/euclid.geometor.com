       <hi rend="ital">If two number be prime to one another, the number which measures the one of them will be prime to the remaining number.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">If two number be prime to one another, the number which measures the one of them will be prime to the remaining number.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two numbers prime to one another, and let any number <span class="ital">C</span> measure <span class="ital">A</span>; I say that <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are also prime to one another. </p>

<p>For, if <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>

<p>Since <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>, and <span class="ital">C</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, therefore <span class="ital">D</span> also measures <span class="ital">A</span>. 
      </p>

<p>But it also measures <span class="ital">B</span>; <pb n="325"/>therefore <span class="ital">D</span> measures <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a href="/elem.7.def.12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
