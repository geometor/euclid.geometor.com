       <span class="ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and each by multiplying itself make some number, the products will be proportional; and, if the original numbers by multiplying the products make certain numbers, the latter will also be proportional.</span>
       <pb n="366"/>
      </p>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, in continued proportion, so that, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying themselves make <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> let them make <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>; I say that <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> and <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> are in continued proportion. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> make <span class="ital">L</span>, and let the numbers <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">L</span> make <span class="ital">M</span>. <span class="ital">N</span> respectively. </p>

<p>And again let <span class="ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> make <span class="ital">O</span>, and let the numbers <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">O</span> make <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span> respectively. </p>

<p>Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we can prove that <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> and <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, and further <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> and <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>

<p>Now, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are also in the same ratio with <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, and further <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> in the same ratio with <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>. </p>

<p>And the multitude of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> is equal to the multitude of <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, and that of <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> to that of <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore, <span class="ital">ex acquali</span>, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>,</span> and, as <span class="ital">G</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">H</span> to <span class="ital">K</span>.
