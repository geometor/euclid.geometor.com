       <hi rend="ital">Similar solid numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Similar solid numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be similar solid numbers; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are similar solid numbers, therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.8.19">VIII. 19</a>] </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> so fall, and let <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, and equal with them in multitude, be taken; [<a href="/elem.7.33">VII. 33</a> or <a href="/elem.8.2">VIII. 2</a>] therefore the extremes of them <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> are cube. [<a href="/elem.8.2.p.1">VIII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>

<p>And, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number. Q. E. D.<pb n="383"/></p>
