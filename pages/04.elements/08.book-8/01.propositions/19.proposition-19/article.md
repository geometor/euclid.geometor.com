<p>
       <span class="ital">Between two similar solid numbers there fall two mean proportional numbers; and the solid number has to the similar solid number the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be two similar solid numbers, and let <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> be the sides of <span class="ital">A</span>, and <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> of <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a href="/elem.7.def.21">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="center">and, as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">E</span>, so is <span class="ital">G</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>I say that between <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> there fall two mean proportional numbers, and <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">C</span> has to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and also <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">D</span> make <span class="ital">K</span>, and let <span class="ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">G</span> make <span class="ital">L</span>. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, and <span class="ital">K</span> is the product of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, and <span class="ital">L</span> the product of <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are similar plane numbers; [<a href="/elem.7.def.21">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore between <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> there is one mean proportional number. [<a href="/elem.8.18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Let it be <span class="ital">M</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">M</span> is the product of <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, as was proved in the theorem preceding this. [<a href="/elem.8.18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">C</span> has made <span class="ital">K</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">F</span> has made <span class="ital">M</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">K</span> to <span class="ital">M</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">K</span> is to <span class="ital">M</span>, so is <span class="ital">M</span> to <span class="ital">L</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>. <pb n="374"/></p>

<p>And since, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">D</span>, so is <span class="ital">F</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, alternately therefore, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, so is <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.13">VII. 13</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason also, <span class="center">as <span class="ital">D</span> is to <span class="ital">G</span>, so is <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">L</span> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>, in the ratio of <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and also in the ratio of <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Next, let <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">M</span> make <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> respectively. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">A</span> is a solid number, and <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span> are its sides, therefore <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying the product of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>But the product of <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> is <span class="ital">K</span>; therefore <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">K</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason also <span class="center"><span class="ital">H</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">L</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">K</span> has made <span class="ital">A</span>, and further also by multiplying <span class="ital">M</span> has made <span class="ital">N</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">K</span> is to <span class="ital">M</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">N</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">K</span> is to <span class="ital">M</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and also <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">N</span>. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">H</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">M</span> have made <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span> respectively, therefore, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.18">VII. 18</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">E</span> is to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">F</span> and <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>; therefore also, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">N</span> and <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>Again, since <span class="ital">H</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">M</span> has made <span class="ital">O</span>, and further also by multiplying <span class="ital">L</span> has made <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">M</span> is to <span class="ital">L</span>, so is <span class="ital">O</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">M</span> is to <span class="ital">L</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, as <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>, so not only is <span class="ital">O</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, but also <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">N</span> and <span class="ital">N</span> to <span class="ital">O</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are continuously proportional in the aforesaid ratios of the sides. </p>

<p>I say that <span class="ital">A</span> also has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number <span class="ital">C</span> has to <span class="ital">F</span>, or <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and also <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. <pb n="375"/></p>

<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> are four numbers in continued proportion, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">N</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.10">V. Def. 10</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">N</span>, so it was proved that <span class="ital">C</span> is to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and also <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number <span class="ital">C</span> has to <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> to <span class="ital">G</span>, and also <span class="ital">E</span> to <span class="ital">H</span>.
