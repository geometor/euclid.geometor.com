       <hi rend="ital">Any solid angle is contained by plane angles less than four right angles.</hi>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Any solid angle is contained by plane angles less than four right angles.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let the angle at <span class="ital">A</span> be a solid angle contained by the plane angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">DAB</span>; I say that the angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">DAB</span> are less than four right angles. </p>

<p>For let points <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> be taken at random on the straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span> respectively, and let <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Now, since the solid angle at <span class="ital">B</span> is contained by the three plane angles <span class="ital">CBA</span>, <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">CBD</span>, any two are greater than the remaining one; [<a href="/elem.11.20">XI. 20</a>] therefore the angles <span class="ital">CBA</span>, <span class="ital">ABD</span> are greater than the angle <span class="ital">CBD</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason the angles <span class="ital">BCA</span>, <span class="ital">ACD</span> are also greater than the angle <span class="ital">BCD</span>, and the angles <span class="ital">CDA</span>, <span class="ital">ADB</span> are greater than the angle <span class="ital">CDB</span>; therefore the six angles <span class="ital">CBA</span>, <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">BCA</span>, <span class="ital">ACD</span>, <span class="ital">CDA</span>, <span class="ital">ADB</span> are greater than the three angles <span class="ital">CBD</span>, <span class="ital">BCD</span>, <span class="ital">CDB</span>. </p>

<p>But the three angles <span class="ital">CBD</span>, <span class="ital">BDC</span>, <span class="ital">BCD</span> are equal to two right angles; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the six angles <span class="ital">CBA</span>, <span class="ital">ABD</span>, <span class="ital">BCA</span>, <span class="ital">ACD</span>, <span class="ital">CDA</span>, <span class="ital">ADB</span> are greater than two right angles. <pb n="310"/></p>

<p>And, since the three angles of each of the triangles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">ACD</span>, <span class="ital">ADB</span> are equal to two right angles, therefore the nine angles of the three triangles, the angles <span class="ital">CBA</span>, <span class="ital">ACB</span>, <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">ACD</span>, <span class="ital">CDA</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">ADB</span>, <span class="ital">DBA</span>, <span class="ital">BAD</span> are equal to six right angles; and of them the six angles <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">BCA</span>, <span class="ital">ACD</span>, <span class="ital">CDA</span>, <span class="ital">ADB</span>, <span class="ital">DBA</span> are greater than two right angles; therefore the remaining three angles <span class="ital">BAC</span>, <span class="ital">CAD</span>, <span class="ital">DAB</span> containing the solid angle are less than four right angles. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
