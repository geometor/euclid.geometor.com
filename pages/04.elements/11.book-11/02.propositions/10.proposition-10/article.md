===

<p><span class="ital">If two straight lines meeting one another be parallel to two straight lines meeting one another not in the same plane</span>, <span class="ital">they will contain equal angles.</span>
      </p>

<p>For let the two straight lines <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> meeting one another be parallel to the two straight lines <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> meeting one another, not in the same plane; I say that the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">ED</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span> be cut off equal to one another, and let <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since <span class="ital">BA</span> is equal and parallel to <span class="ital">ED</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is also equal and parallel to <span class="ital">BE</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">CF</span> is also equal and parallel to <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore each of the straight lines <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">CF</span> is equal and parallel to <span class="ital">BE</span>. </p>

<p>But straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are parallel to one another; [<a href="/elem.11.9">XI. 9</a>] therefore <span class="ital">AD</span> is parallel and equal to <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>And <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">DF</span> join them; therefore <span class="ital">AC</span> is also equal and parallel to <span class="ital">DF</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>] </p>

<p>Now, since the two sides <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">DE</span>, <span class="ital">EF</span>, and the base <span class="ital">AC</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">DF</span>, therefore the angle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">DEF</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc.<pb n="292"/></p>
