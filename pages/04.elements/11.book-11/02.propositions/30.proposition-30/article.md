<p><span class="ital">Parallelepipedal solids which are on the same base and of the same height</span>, <span class="ital">and in which the extremities of the sides which stand up are not on the same straight lines</span>, <span class="ital">are equal to one another.</span>
       <pb n="335"/></p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">CM</span>, <span class="ital">CN</span> be parallelepipedal solids on the same base <span class="ital">AB</span> and of the same height, and let the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">LN</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">BH</span>, <span class="ital">BK</span>, not be on the same straight lines; I say that the solid <span class="ital">CM</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CN</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">NK</span>, <span class="ital">DH</span> be produced and meet one another at <span class="ital">R</span>, and further let <span class="ital">FM</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span> be produced to <span class="ital">P</span>, <span class="ital">Q</span>; let <span class="ital">AO</span>, <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">CQ</span>, <span class="ital">BR</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Then the solid <span class="ital">CM</span>, of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">ACBL</span> is the base, and <span class="ital">FDHM</span> its opposite, is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CP</span>, of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">ACBL</span> is the base, and <span class="ital">OQRP</span> its opposite; for they are on the same base <span class="ital">ACBL</span> and of the same height, and the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">AO</span>, <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <span class="ital">CQ</span>, <span class="ital">BH</span>, <span class="ital">BR</span>, are on the same straight lines <span class="ital">FP</span>, <span class="ital">DR</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.29">XI. 29</a>] </p>

<p>But the solid <span class="ital">CP</span>, of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">ACBL</span> is the base, and <span class="ital">OQRP</span> its opposite, is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CN</span>, of which the parallelogram <span class="ital">ACBL</span> is the base and <span class="ital">GEKN</span> its opposite; for they are again on the same base <span class="ital">ACBL</span> and of the same height, and the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely <span class="ital">AG</span>, <span class="ital">AO</span>, <span class="ital">CE</span>, <span class="ital">CQ</span>, <span class="ital">LN</span>, <span class="ital">LP</span>, <span class="ital">BK</span>, <span class="ital">BR</span>, are on the same straight lines <span class="ital">GQ</span>, <span class="ital">NR</span>. </p>

<p>Hence the solid <span class="ital">CM</span> is also equal to the solid <span class="ital">CN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
