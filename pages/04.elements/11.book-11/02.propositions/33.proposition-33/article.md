       <hi rend="ital">Similar parallelepipedal solids are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.</hi>
      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Similar parallelepipedal solids are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span> be similar parallelepipedal solids, and let <span class="ital">AE</span> be the side corresponding to <span class="ital">CF</span>; I say that the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> has to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AE</span> has to <span class="ital">CF</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">EL</span>, <span class="ital">EM</span> be produced in a straight line with <span class="ital">AE</span>, <span class="ital">GE</span>, <span class="ital">HE</span>, let <span class="ital">EK</span> be made equal to <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">EL</span> equal to <span class="ital">FN</span>, and further <span class="ital">EM</span> equal to <span class="ital">FR</span>, and let the parallelogram <span class="ital">KL</span> and the solid <span class="ital">KP</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Now, since the two sides <span class="ital">KE</span>, <span class="ital">EL</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">CF</span>, <span class="ital">FN</span>, while the angle <span class="ital">KEL</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">CFN</span>, inasmuch as the angle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">CFN</span> because of the similarity of the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, <pb n="343"/>therefore the parallelogram <span class="ital">KL</span> is equal &lt;and similar&gt; to the parallelogram <span class="ital">CN</span>. </p>

<p>For the same reason the parallelogram <span class="ital">KM</span> is also equal and similar to <span class="ital">CR</span>, and further <span class="ital">EP</span> to <span class="ital">DF</span>; therefore three parallelograms of the solid <span class="ital">KP</span> are equal and similar to three parallelograms of the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. </p>

<p>But the former three parallelograms are equal and similar to their opposites, and the latter three to their opposites; [<a href="/elem.11.24">XI. 24</a>] therefore the whole solid <span class="ital">KP</span> is equal and similar to the whole solid <span class="ital">CD</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</a>] </p>

<p>Let the parallelogram <span class="ital">GK</span> be completed, and on the parallelograms <span class="ital">GK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span> as bases, and with the same height as that of <span class="ital">AB</span>, let the solids <span class="ital">EO</span>, <span class="ital">LQ</span> be completed. </p>

<p>Then since; owing to the similarity of the solids <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">CD</span>, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="ital">EG</span> to <span class="ital">FN</span>, and <span class="ital">EH</span> to <span class="ital">FR</span>, while <span class="ital">CF</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EK</span>, <span class="ital">FN</span> to <span class="ital">EL</span>, and <span class="ital">FR</span> to <span class="ital">EM</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EK</span>, so is <span class="ital">GE</span> to <span class="ital">EL</span>, and <span class="ital">HE</span> to <span class="ital">EM</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AE</span> is to <span class="ital">EK</span>, so is <span class="ital">AG</span> to the parallelogram <span class="ital">GK</span>, as <span class="ital">GE</span> is to <span class="ital">EL</span>, so is <span class="ital">GK</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>, and, as <span class="ital">HE</span> is to <span class="ital">EM</span>, so is <span class="ital">QE</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore also, as the parallelogram <span class="ital">AG</span> is to <span class="ital">GK</span>, so is <span class="ital">GK</span> to <span class="ital">KL</span>, and <span class="ital">QE</span> to <span class="ital">KM</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AG</span> is to <span class="ital">GK</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> to the solid <span class="ital">EO</span>, as <span class="ital">GK</span> is to <span class="ital">KL</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">OE</span> to the solid <span class="ital">QL</span>, and, as <span class="ital">QE</span> is to <span class="ital">KM</span>, so is the solid <span class="ital">QL</span> to the solid <span class="ital">KP</span>; [<a href="/elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] therefore also, as the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">EO</span>, so is <span class="ital">EO</span> to <span class="ital">QL</span>, and <span class="ital">QL</span> to <span class="ital">KP</span>. </p>

<p>But, if four magnitudes be continuously proportional, the first has to the fourth the ratio triplicate of that which it has to the second; [<a href="/elem.5.def.10">V. Def. 10</a>] therefore the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">KP</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AB</span> has to <span class="ital">EO</span>. </p>

<p>But, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">EO</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="ital">AG</span> to <span class="ital">GK</span>, and the straight line <span class="ital">AE</span> to <span class="ital">EK</span> [<a href="/elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>]; <pb n="344"/>hence the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> has also to <span class="ital">KP</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="ital">AE</span> has to <span class="ital">EK</span>. </p>

<p>But the solid <span class="ital">KP</span> is equal to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span>, and the straight line <span class="ital">EK</span> to <span class="ital">CF</span>; therefore the solid <span class="ital">AB</span> has also to the solid <span class="ital">CD</span> the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side of it, <span class="ital">AE</span>, has to the corresponding side <span class="ital">CF</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D. </p>
<div id="elem.11.33.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
       
<p>From this it is manifest that, if four straight lines be &lt;continuously&gt; proportional, as the first is to the fourth, so will a parallelepipedal solid on the first be to the similar and similarly described parallelepipedal solid on the second, inasmuch as the first has to the fourth the ratio triplicate of that which it has to the second.</p>
