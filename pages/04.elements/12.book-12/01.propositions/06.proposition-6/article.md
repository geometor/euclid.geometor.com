      </p>

===

<p>
       <span class="ital">Pyramids which are of the same height and have polygonal bases are to one another as the bases.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let there be pyramids of the same height of which the polygons <span class="ital">ABCDE</span>, <span class="ital">FGHKL</span> are the bases and the points <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span> the vertices; I say that, as the base <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FGHKL</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDEM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHKLN</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">AC</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">FH</span>, <span class="ital">FK</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Since then <span class="ital">ABCM</span>, <span class="ital">ACDM</span> are two pyramids which have triangular bases and equal height, they are to one another as the bases; [<a href="/elem.12.5">XII. 5</a>] therefore, as the base <span class="ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="ital">ACD</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">ACDM</span>. </p>

<p>And, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, as the base <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="ital">ACD</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">ACDM</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] </p>

<p>But also, as the base <span class="ital">ACD</span> is to the base <span class="ital">ADE</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ACDM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">ADEM</span>. [<a href="/elem.12.5">XII. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as the base <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="ital">ADE</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">ADEM</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>And again <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, as the base <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">ADE</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDEM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">ADEM</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Similarly also it can be proved that, as the base <span class="ital">FGHKL</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FGH</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHKLN</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHN</span>. <pb n="393"/></p>

<p>And, since <span class="ital">ADEM</span>, <span class="ital">FGHN</span> are two pyramids which have triangular bases and equal height, therefore, as the base <span class="ital">ADE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FGH</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ADEM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHN</span>. [<a href="/elem.12.5">XII. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But, as the base <span class="ital">ADE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">ABCDE</span>, so was the pyramid <span class="ital">ADEM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDEM</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as the base <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FGH</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDEM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHN</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But further, as the base <span class="ital">FGH</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FGHKL</span>, so also was the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHN</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHKLN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore also, <span class="ital">ex aequali</span>, as the base <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> is to the base <span class="ital">FGHKL</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCDEM</span> to the pyramid <span class="ital">FGHKLN</span>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
