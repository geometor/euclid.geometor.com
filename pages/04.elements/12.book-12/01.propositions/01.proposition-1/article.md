<p>
       <span class="ital">Similar polygons inscribed in circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.</span>
      </p>

<p>Let <span class="ital">ABC</span>, <span class="ital">FGH</span> be circles, let <span class="ital">ABCDE</span>, <span class="ital">FGHKL</span> be similar polygons inscribed in them, and let <span class="ital">BM</span>, <span class="ital">GN</span> be diameters of the circles; I say that, as the square on <span class="ital">BM</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">GN</span>, so is the polygon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> to the polygon <span class="ital">FGHKL</span>. 
      </p>

<p>For let <span class="ital">BE</span>, <span class="ital">AM</span>, <span class="ital">GL</span>, <span class="ital">FN</span> be joined. </p>

<p>Now, since the polygon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> is similar to the polygon <span class="ital">FGHKL</span>, the angle <span class="ital">BAE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">GFL</span>, and, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AE</span>, so is <span class="ital">GF</span> to <span class="ital">FL</span>. [VI. Def. I] </p>

<p>Thus <span class="ital">BAE</span>, <span class="ital">GFL</span> are two triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <span class="ital">BAE</span> to the angle <span class="ital">GFL</span>, and the sides about the equal angles proportional; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ABE</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">FGL</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.6">VI. 6</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">AEB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">FLG</span>. <pb n="370"/></p>

<p>But the angle <span class="ital">AEB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">AMB</span>, for they stand on the same circumference; [<a href="/elem.3.27">III. 27</a>] and the angle <span class="ital">FLG</span> to the angle <span class="ital">FNG</span>; therefore the angle <span class="ital">AMB</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="ital">FNG</span>. </p>

<p>But the right angle <span class="ital">BAM</span> is also equal to the right angle <span class="ital">GFN</span>; [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] therefore the remaining angle is equal to the remaining angle. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ABM</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">FGN</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">BM</span> is to <span class="ital">GN</span>, so is <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">GF</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>

<p>But the ratio of the square on <span class="ital">BM</span> to the square on <span class="ital">GN</span> is duplicate of the ratio of <span class="ital">BM</span> to <span class="ital">GN</span>, and the ratio of the polygon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> to the polygon <span class="ital">FGHKL</span> is duplicate of the ratio of <span class="ital">BA</span> to <span class="ital">GF</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.20">VI. 20</a>] therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">BM</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">GN</span>, so is the polygon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> to the polygon <span class="ital">FGHKL</span>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
