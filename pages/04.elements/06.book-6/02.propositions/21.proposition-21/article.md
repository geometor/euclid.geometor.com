<p><emph>Figures which are similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Figures which are similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another</em>. </p>

<p>For let each of the rectilineal figures <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> be similar to <em>C</em>; I say that <em>A</em> is also similar to <em>B</em>. <pb n="240"/></p>

<p>For, since <em>A</em> is similar to <em>C</em>, it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Again, since <em>B</em> is similar to <em>C</em>, it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. </p>

<p>Therefore each of the figures <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> is equiangular with <em>C</em> and with <em>C</em> has the sides about the equal angles proportional; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is similar to <em>B</em>. Q. E. D.</span></p>
