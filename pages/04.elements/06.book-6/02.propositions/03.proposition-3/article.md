<p><em>If an angle of a triangle be bisected and the straight line cutting the angle cut the base also</em>, <em>the segments of the base will have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle; and</em>, <em>if the segments of the base have the same ratio as the <pb n="196"/>remaining sides of the triangle</em>, <em>the straight line joined from the vertex to the point of section will bisect the angle of the triangle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be a triangle, and let the angle <em>BAC</em> be bisected by the straight line <em>AD</em>; I say that, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>BA</em> to <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>CE</em> be drawn through <em>C</em> parallel to <em>DA</em>, and let <em>BA</em>
        be carried through and meet it at <em>E</em>. </p>

<p>Then, since the straight line <em>AC</em> falls upon the parallels <em>AD</em>, <em>EC</em>, <span class="center">the angle <em>ACE</em> is equal to the angle <em>CAD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>CAD</em> is by hypothesis equal to the angle <em>BAD</em>; therefore the angle <em>BAD</em> is also equal to the angle <em>ACE</em>. </p>

<p>Again, since the straight line <em>BAE</em> falls upon the parallels <em>AD</em>, <em>EC</em>, <span class="center">the exterior angle <em>BAD</em> is equal to the interior angle <em>AEC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>ACE</em> was also proved equal to the angle <em>BAD</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>ACE</em> is also equal to the angle <em>AEC</em>, so that the side <em>AE</em> is also equal to the side <em>AC</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>AD</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>EC</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>BCE</em>, therefore, proportionally, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DC</em>, so is <em>BA</em> to <em>AE</em>. </p>

<p>But <em>AE</em> is equal to <em>AC</em>; [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] therefore, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DC</em>, so is <em>BA</em> to <em>AC</em>. </p>

<p>Again, let <em>BA</em> be to <em>AC</em> as <em>BD</em> to <em>DC</em>, and let <em>AD</em> be joined; I say that the angle <em>BAC</em> has been bisected by the straight line <title>A.D</title>. </p>

<p>For, with the same construction, since, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DC</em>, so is <em>BA</em> to <em>AC</em>, <pb n="197"/>and also, as <em>BD</em> is to <em>DC</em>, so is <em>BA</em> to <em>AE</em> : for <em>AD</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>EC</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>BCE</em>: [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] therefore also, as <em>BA</em> is to <em>AC</em>, so is <em>BA</em> to <em>AE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore <em>AC</em> is equal to <em>AE</em>, [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] so that the angle <em>AEC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>ACE</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.5">I. 5</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <em>AEC</em> is equal to the exterior angle <em>BAD</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] and the angle <em>ACE</em> is equal to the alternate angle <em>CAD</em>; [<em>id</em>.] <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAD</em> is also equal to the angle <em>CAD</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore the angle <em>BAC</em> has been bisected by the straight line <em>AD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
