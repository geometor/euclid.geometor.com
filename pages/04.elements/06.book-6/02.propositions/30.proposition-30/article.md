To cut a given finite straight line in extreme and mean ratio.

===

To cut a given finite straight line in extreme and mean ratio.

Let `AB` be the given finite straight line; <span class="center">thus it is required to cut `AB` in extreme and mean ratio.</span>

On `AB` let the square `BC` be described; and let there be applied to `AC` the parallelogram `CD` equal to `BC` and exceeding by the figure `AD` similar to `BC`. [<a href="/elem.6.29">VI. 29</a>]

Now `BC` is a square; <span class="center">therefore `AD` is also a square.</span>

And, since `BC` is equal to `CD`, let `CE` be subtracted from each; <span class="center">therefore the remainder `BF` is equal to the remainder `AD`.</span>
<!-- <pb n="268"/> -->

But it is also equiangular with it; therefore in `BF`, `AD` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; [<a href="/elem.6.14">VI. 14</a>] <span class="center">therefore, as `FE` is to `ED`, so is `AE` to `EB`.</span>

But `FE` is equal to `AB`, and `ED` to `AE`.

Therefore, as `BA` is to `AE`, so is `AE` to `EB`.

And `AB` is greater than `AE`; <span class="center">therefore `AE` is also greater than `EB`.</span>

Therefore the straight line `AB` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at `E`, and the greater segment of it is `AE`. Q. E. F.
