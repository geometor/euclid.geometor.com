<p><emph>From a given straight line to cut off a prescribed part</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>From a given straight line to cut off a prescribed part</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut off from <em>AB</em> a prescribed part. <pb n="212"/></p>

<p>Let the third part be that prescribed. <lb n="5"/></p>

<p>Let a straight line <em>AC</em> be drawn through from <em>A</em> containing with <em>AB</em> any angle; let a point <em>D</em> be taken at random on <em>AC</em>, and let <em>DE</em>, <em>EC</em> be made equal to <em>AD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.3">I. 3</a>] 
       <lb n="10"/></p>

<p>Let <em>BC</em> be joined, and through <em>D</em> let <em>DF</em> be drawn parallel to it. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>] </p>

<p>Then, since <em>FD</em> has been drawn parallel to <em>BC</em>, one of the sides of the triangle <em>ABC</em>, therefore, proportionally, as <em>CD</em> is to <em>DA</em>, so is <em>BF</em> to <em>FA</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] <lb n="15"/></p>

<p>But <em>CD</em> is double of <em>DA</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>BF</em> is also double of <em>FA</em>; therefore <em>BA</em> is triple of <em>AF</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore from the given straight line <em>AB</em> the prescribed third part <em>AF</em> has been cut off. Q. E. F.
<blockquote n="6" class="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
        
<p><span class="bold">any angle</span>. The expression here and in the two following propositions is <foreign lang="greek">τυχοῦσα γωνία</foreign>, corresponding exactly to <foreign lang="greek">τυχὸν σημεῖον</foreign> which I have translated as <quote>a point (taken) <em>at random</em></quote>
; but <quote>an angle (taken) at random</quote>
 would not be so appropriate where it is a question, not of <em>taking</em> any angle at all, but of drawing a straight line casually so as to make any angle with another straight line.</p>
