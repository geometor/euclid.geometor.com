<p><emph>If four straight lines be proportional</emph>, <emph>the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them will also be proportional</emph>; <emph>and</emph>, <emph>if the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them be proportional</emph>, <emph>the straight lines will themselves also be proportional</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>If four straight lines be proportional</em>, <em>the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them will also be proportional</em>; <em>and</em>, <em>if the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them be proportional</em>, <em>the straight lines will themselves also be proportional</em>. </p>

<p>Let the four straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>EF</em>, <em>GH</em> be proportional, so that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>GH</em>, and let there be described on <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <em>KAB</em>, <em>LCD</em>, and on <em>EF</em>, <em>GH</em> the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <em>MF</em>, <em>NH</em>; I say that, as <em>KAB</em> is to <em>LCD</em>, so is <em>MF</em> to <em>NH</em>. </p>

<p>For let there be taken a third proportional <em>O</em> to <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em>, and a third proportional <em>P</em> to <em>EF</em>, <em>GH</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.11">VI. 11</a>] <pb n="241"/></p>

<p>Then since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>GH</em>, <span class="center">and, as <em>CD</em> is to <em>O</em>, so is <em>GH</em> to <em>P</em>,</span> therefore, <em>ex aequali</em>, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>O</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>P</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.22">V. 22</a>] </p>

<p>But, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>O</em>, so is <em>KAB</em> to <em>LCD</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.19.p.1">VI. 19, Por.</a>] <span class="center">and, as <em>EF</em> is to <em>P</em>, so is <em>MF</em> to <em>NH</em>;</span> therefore also, as <em>KAB</em> is to <em>LCD</em>, so is <em>MF</em> to <em>NH</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>] 
      </p>

<p>Next, let <em>MF</em> be to <em>NH</em> as <em>KAB</em> is to <em>LCD</em>; I say also that, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>GH</em>. </p>

<p>For, if <em>EF</em> is not to <em>GH</em> as <em>AB</em> to <em>CD</em>, <span class="center">let <em>EF</em> be to <em>QR</em> as <em>AB</em> to <em>CD</em>, [<a href="/elem.6.12">VI. 12</a>]</span> and on <em>QR</em> let the rectilineal figure <em>SR</em> be described similar and similarly situated to either of the two <em>MF</em>, <em>NH</em>. [<a href="/elem.6.18">VI. 18</a>] </p>

<p>Since then, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>QR</em>, and there have been described on <em>AB</em>, <em>CD</em> the similar and similarly situated figures <em>KAB</em>, <em>LCD</em>, and on <em>EF</em>, <em>QR</em> the similar and similarly situated figures <em>MF</em>, <em>SR</em>, therefore, as <em>KAB</em> is to <em>LCD</em>, so is <em>MF</em> to <em>SR</em>. </p>

<p>But also, by hypothesis, <span class="center">as <em>KAB</em> is to <em>LCD</em>, so is <em>MF</em> to <em>NH</em>; therefore also, as <em>MF</em> is to <em>SR</em>, so is <em>MF</em> to <em>NH</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.11">V. 11</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore <em>MF</em> has the same ratio to each of the figures <em>NH</em>, <em>SR</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>NH</em> is equal to <em>SR</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.9">V. 9</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>But it is also similar and similarly situated to it; <span class="center">therefore <em>GH</em> is equal to <em>QR</em>.</span>
       <pb n="242"/></p>

<p>And, since, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>QR</em>, while <em>QR</em> is equal to <em>GH</em>, therefore, as <em>AB</em> is to <em>CD</em>, so is <em>EF</em> to <em>GH</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
