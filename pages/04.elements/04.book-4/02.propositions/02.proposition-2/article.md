<p><emph>In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABC</em> be the given circle, and <em>DEF</em> the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle <em>ABC</em> a triangle equiangular with the triangle <em>DEF</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>GH</em> be drawn touching the circle <em>ABC</em> at <em>A</em> [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>]; <pb n="82"/>on the straight line <em>AH</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, let the angle <em>HAC</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>, and on the straight line <em>AG</em>, and at the point <em>A</em> on it, let the angle <em>GAB</em> be constructed equal to the angle <em>DFE</em>; [<a href="/elem.1.23">I. 23</a>] let <em>BC</em> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since a straight line <em>AH</em> touches the circle <em>ABC</em>, and from the point of contact at <em>A</em> the straight line <em>AC</em> is drawn across in the circle, therefore the angle <em>HAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>ABC</em> in the alternate segment of the circle. [<a href="/elem.3.32">III. 32</a>] </p>

<p>But the angle <em>HAC</em> is equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>; therefore the angle <em>ABC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DEF</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angle <em>ACB</em> is also equal to the angle <em>DFE</em>;</span> therefore the remaining angle <em>BAC</em> is also equal to the remaining angle <em>EDF</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore in the given circle there has been inscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F.</p>
