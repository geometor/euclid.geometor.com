<p><emph>About a given pentagon</emph>, <emph>which is equilateral and equiangular</emph>, <emph>to circumscribe a circle</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>About a given pentagon</em>, <em>which is equilateral and equiangular</em>, <em>to circumscribe a circle</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCDE</em> be the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon <em>ABCDE</em>. </p>

<p>Let the angles <em>BCD</em>, <em>CDE</em> be bisected by the straight lines <em>CF</em>, <em>DF</em> respectively, and from the point <em>F</em>, at which the straight lines meet, let the straight lines <em>FB</em>, <em>FA</em>, <em>FE</em> be joined to the points <em>B</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Then in manner similar to the preceding it can be proved that the angles <em>CBA</em>, <em>BAE</em>, <em>AED</em> have also been bisected by the straight lines <em>FB</em>, <em>FA</em>, <em>FE</em> respectively. <pb n="107"/></p>

<p>Now, since the angle <em>BCD</em> is equal to the angle <em>CDE</em>, and the angle <em>FCD</em> is half of the angle <em>BCD</em>, and the angle <em>CDF</em> half of the angle <em>CDE</em>, therefore the angle <em>FCD</em> is also equal to the angle <em>CDF</em>, <span class="center">so that the side <em>FC</em> is also equal to the side <em>FD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.6">I. 6</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines <em>FB</em>, <em>FA</em>, <em>FE</em> is also equal to each of the straight lines <em>FC</em>, <em>FD</em>; therefore the five straight lines <em>FA</em>, <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em>, <em>FD</em>, <em>FE</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore the circle described with centre <em>F</em> and distance one of the straight lines <em>FA</em>, <em>FB</em>, <em>FC</em>, <em>FD</em>, <em>FE</em> will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed. </p>

<p>Let it be circumscribed, and let it be <em>ABCDE</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore about the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
