<p><emph>In a given circle to inscribe a square</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>In a given circle to inscribe a square</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCD</em> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe a square in the circle <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Let two diameters <em>AC</em>, <em>BD</em> of the circle <em>ABCD</em> be drawn at right angles to one another, and let <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DA</em> be joined. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since <em>BE</em> is equal to <em>ED</em>, for <em>E</em> is the centre, and <em>EA</em> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <em>AB</em> is equal to the base <em>AD</em>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>

<p>For the same reason each of the straight lines <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em> is also equal to each of the straight lines <em>AB</em>, <em>AD</em>; <span class="center">therefore the quadrilateral <em>ABCD</em> is equilateral.</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next that it is also right-angled. </p>

<p>For, since the straight line <em>BD</em> is a diameter of the circle <em>ABCD</em>, therefore <em>BAD</em> is a semicircle; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>BAD</em> is right. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason each of the angles <em>ABC</em>, <em>BCD</em>, <em>CDA</em> is also right; <span class="center">therefore the quadrilateral <em>ABCD</em> is right-angled.</span>
      </p>

<p>But it was also proved equilateral; therefore it is a square; [<a href="/elem.1.def.22">I. Def. 22</a>] and it has been inscribed in the circle <em>ABCD</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore in the given circle the square <em>ABCD</em> has been inscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
