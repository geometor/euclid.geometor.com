<p><emph>About a given circle to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>About a given circle to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>ABCDE</em> be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about the circle <em>ABCDE</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> be conceived to be the angular points of the inscribed pentagon, so that the circumferences <em>AB</em>, <em>BC</em>, <em>CD</em>, <em>DE</em>, <em>EA</em> are equal; [<a href="/elem.4.11">IV. 11</a>]  through <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>E</em> let <em>GH</em>, <em>HK</em>, <em>KL</em>, <em>LM</em>, <em>MG</em> be drawn touching the circle; [<a href="/elem.3.16.p.1">III. 16, Por.</a>] let the centre <em>F</em> of the circle <em>ABCDE</em> be taken [<a href="/elem.3.1">III. 1</a>], and let <em>FB</em>, <em>FK</em>, <em>FC</em>, <em>FL</em>, <em>FD</em> be joined. </p>

<p>Then, since the straight line <em>KL</em> touches the circle <em>ABCDE</em> at <em>C</em>, and <em>FC</em> has been joined from the centre <em>F</em> to the point of contact at <em>C</em>, <span class="center">therefore <em>FC</em> is perpendicular to <em>KL</em>; [<a href="/elem.3.18">III. 18</a>] therefore each of the angles at <em>C</em> is right.</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angles at the points <em>B</em>, <em>D</em> are also right.</span>
       <pb n="103"/></p>

<p>And, since the angle <em>FCK</em> is right, therefore the square on <em>FK</em> is equal to the squares on <em>FC</em>, <em>CK</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason [<a href="/elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] <span class="center">the square on <em>FK</em> is also equal to the squares on <em>FB</em>, <em>BK</em>; so that the squares on <em>FC</em>, <em>CK</em> are equal to the squares on <em>FB</em>, <em>BK</em>, of which the square on <em>FC</em> is equal to the square on <em>FB</em>;</span> therefore the square on <em>CK</em> which remains is equal to the square on <em>BK</em>. </p>

<p>Therefore <em>BK</em> is equal to <em>CK</em>. </p>

<p>And, since <em>FB</em> is equal to <em>FC</em>, and <em>FK</em> common, <span class="center">the two sides <em>BF</em>, <em>FK</em> are equal to the two sides <em>CF</em>, <em>FK</em>; and the base <em>BK</em> equal to the base <em>CK</em>; therefore the angle <em>BFK</em> is equal to the angle <em>KFC</em>, [<a href="/elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] and the angle <em>BKF</em> to the angle <em>FKC</em>.</span> Therefore the angle <em>BFC</em> is double of the angle <em>KFC</em>, <span class="center">and the angle <em>BKC</em> of the angle <em>FKC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason <span class="center">the angle <em>CFD</em> is also double of the angle <em>CFL</em>, and the angle <em>DLC</em> of the angle <em>FLC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Now, since the circumference <em>BC</em> is equal to <em>CD</em>, the angle <em>BFC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>CFD</em>. [<a href="/elem.3.27">III. 27</a>] </p>

<p>And the angle <em>BFC</em> is double of the angle <em>KFC</em>, and the angle <em>DFC</em> of the angle <em>LFC</em>; <span class="center">therefore the angle <em>KFC</em> is also equal to the angle <em>LFC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>But the angle <em>FCK</em> is also equal to the angle <em>FCL</em>; therefore <em>FKC</em>, <em>FLC</em> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <em>FC</em> which is common to them; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [<a href="/elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] <span class="center">therefore the straight line <em>KC</em> is equal to <em>CL</em>, and the angle <em>FKC</em> to the angle <em>FLC</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And, since <em>KC</em> is equal to <em>CL</em>, therefore <em>KL</em> is double of <em>KC</em>. <pb n="104"/></p>

<p>For the same reason it can be proved that <span class="center"><em>HK</em> is also double of <em>BK</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>And <em>BK</em> is equal to <em>KC</em>; <span class="center">therefore <em>HK</em> is also equal to <em>KL</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly each of the straight lines <em>HG</em>, <em>GM</em>, <em>ML</em> can also be proved equal to each of the straight lines <em>HK</em>, <em>KL</em>; <span class="center">therefore the pentagon <em>GHKLM</em> is equilateral.</span>
      </p>

<p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>

<p>For, since the angle <em>FKC</em> is equal to the angle <em>FLC</em>, and the angle <em>HKL</em> was proved double of the angle <em>FKC</em>, <span class="center">and the angle <em>KLM</em> double of the angle <em>FLC</em>, therefore the angle <em>HKL</em> is also equal to the angle <em>KLM</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Similarly each of the angles <em>KHG</em>, <em>HGM</em>, <em>GML</em> can also be proved equal to each of the angles <em>HKL</em>, <em>KLM</em>; therefore the five angles <em>GHK</em>, <em>HKL</em>, <em>KLM</em>, <em>LMG</em>, <em>MGH</em> are equal to one another. </p>

<p>Therefore the pentagon <em>GHKLM</em> is equiangular. </p>

<p>And it was also proved equilateral; and it has been circumscribed about the circle <em>ABCDE</em>. Q. E. F.</p>
