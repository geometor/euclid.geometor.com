<p><emph>If there be any number of magnitudes whatever</emph>, <emph>and others equal to them in multitude</emph>, <emph>which taken two and two together are in the same ratio</emph>, <emph>they will also be in the same ratio</emph> ex aequali. </p>

<p><em>If there be any number of magnitudes whatever</em>, <em>and others equal to them in multitude</em>, <em>which taken two and two together are in the same ratio</em>, <em>they will also be in the same ratio</em> ex aequali. </p>

<p>Let there be any number of magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, and others <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em> equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, so that, <span class="center">as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>E</em>,</span> and, as <em>B</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>; I say that they will also be in the same ratio <em>ex aequali</em>, <span class="center">&lt;that is, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>F</em>&gt;.</span>
       <pb n="180"/></p>

<p>For of <em>A</em>, <em>D</em> let equimultiples <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> be taken, and of <em>B</em>, <em>E</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>; and, further, of <em>C</em>, <em>F</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>. 
      </p>

<p>Then, since, as <em>A</em> is to <em>B</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>E</em>, and of <em>A</em>, <em>D</em> equimultiples <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> have been taken, and of <em>B</em>, <em>E</em> other, chance, equimultiples <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>, <span class="center">therefore, as <em>G</em> is to <em>K</em>, so is <em>H</em> to <em>L</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.4">V. 4</a>]</span>
      </p>

<p>For the same reason also, <span class="center">as <em>K</em> is to <em>M</em>, so is <em>L</em> to <em>N</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Since, then, there are three magnitudes <em>G</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>M</em>, and others <em>H</em>, <em>L</em>, <em>N</em> equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, if <em>G</em> is in excess of <em>M</em>, <em>H</em> is also in excess of <em>N</em>; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [<a href="/elem.5.20">V. 20</a>] </p>

<p>And <em>G</em>, <em>H</em> are equimultiples of <em>A</em>, <em>D</em>, <span class="center">and <em>M</em>, <em>N</em> other, chance, equimultiples of <em>C</em>, <em>F</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore, as <em>A</em> is to <em>C</em>, so is <em>D</em> to <em>F</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
