<p><emph>Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them taken in corresponding order</emph>. </p>

===

<p><em>Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them taken in corresponding order</em>. </p>

<p>For let <em>AB</em> be the same multiple of <em>C</em> that <em>DE</em> is of <em>F</em>; I say that, as <em>C</em> is to <em>F</em>, so is <em>AB</em> to <em>DE</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, since <em>AB</em> is the same multiple of <em>C</em> that <em>DE</em> is of <em>F</em>, as many magnitudes as there are in <em>AB</em> equal to <em>C</em>, so many are there also in <em>DE</em> equal to <em>F</em>. </p>

<p>Let <em>AB</em> be divded into the magnitudes <em>AG</em>, <em>GH</em>, <em>HB</em> equal to <em>C</em>, and <em>DE</em> into the magnitudes <em>DK</em>, <em>KL</em>, <em>LE</em> equal to <em>F</em>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <em>AG</em>, <em>GH</em>, <em>HB</em> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <em>DK</em>, <em>KL</em>, <em>LE</em>. </p>

<p>And, since <em>AG</em>. <em>GH</em>, <em>HB</em> are equal to one another, and <em>DK</em>, <em>KL</em>, <em>LE</em> are also equal to one another, therefore, as <em>AG</em> is to <em>DK</em>, so is <em>GH</em> to <em>KL</em>, and <em>HB</em> to <em>LE</em>. [<a href="/elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] </p>

<p>Therefore, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents; [<a href="/elem.5.12">V. 12</a>] <span class="center">therefore, as <em>AG</em> is to <em>DK</em>, so is <em>AB</em> to <em>DE</em>.</span>
       <pb n="164"/></p>

<p>But <em>AG</em> is equal to <em>C</em> and <em>DK</em> to <em>F</em>; <span class="center">therefore, as <em>C</em> is to <em>F</em>, so is <em>AB</em> to <em>DE</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
