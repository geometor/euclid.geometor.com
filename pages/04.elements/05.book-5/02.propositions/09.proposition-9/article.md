<p><emph>Magnitudes which have the same ratio to the same are equal to one another</emph>; <emph>and magnitudes to which the same has the same ratio are equal</emph>. <pb n="154"/></p>

===

<p><em>Magnitudes which have the same ratio to the same are equal to one another</em>; <em>and magnitudes to which the same has the same ratio are equal</em>. <pb n="154"/></p>

<p>For let each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> have the same ratio to <em>C</em>; I say that <em>A</em> is equal to <em>B</em>. 
      </p>

<p>For, otherwise, each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> would not have had the same ratio to <em>C</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.8">V. 8</a>] but it has; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is equal to <em>B</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Again, let <em>C</em> have the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>; I say that <em>A</em> is equal to <em>B</em>. </p>

<p>For, otherwise, <em>C</em> would not have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>; [<a href="/elem.5.8">V. 8</a>] but it has; <span class="center">therefore <em>A</em> is equal to <em>B</em>.</span>
      </p>

<p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
