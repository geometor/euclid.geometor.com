In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

===

Let `ABC` be a triangle, and let one side of it `BC` be produced to `D`; 

I say that the exterior angle [^1] `ACD`is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles [^2] `CBA`, `BAC`.

Let `AC` be bisected at `E` [1.10], and let `BE` be joined and produced in a straight line to `F`;

let `EF` be made equal to `BE`[1.3], let `FC` be joined [1.post.1], and let `AC` be drawn through to `G` [^3] [1.post.2].

Then, since `AE` is equal to `EC`, and `BE` to `EF`, 

- the two sides `AE`, `EB` are equal to the two sides `CE`, `EF` respectively; and the angle `AEB` is equal to the angle `FEC`, for they are vertical angles. [1.15] Therefore the base `AB` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `ABE` is equal to the triangle `CFE` [^4], and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [1.4] therefore the angle `BAE` is equal to the angle `ECF`.

But the angle `ECD` is greater than the angle `ECF`; [1.c.n.5] 

- therefore the angle `ACD` is greater than the angle `BAE`.

Similarly also, if `BC` be bisected, the angle `BCG`, that is, the angle `ACD` [1.15], can be proved greater than the angle `ABC` as well.

Therefore etc.
