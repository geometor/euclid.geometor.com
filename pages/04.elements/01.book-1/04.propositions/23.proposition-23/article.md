On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.

===

Let `AB` be the given straight line, `A` the point on it, and the angle `DCE` the given rectilineal angle;

thus it is required to construct on the given straight line `AB`, and at the point `A` on it, a rectilineal angle equal to the given rectilineal angle `DCE`. 

On the straight lines `CD`, `CE` respectively let the points `D`, `E` be taken at random; let `DE` be joined, and out of three straight lines which are equal to the three <pb n="295"/>straight lines `CD`, `DE`, `CE` let the triangle `AFG` be constructed in such a way that `CD` is equal to `AF`, `CE` to `AG`, and further `DE` to `FG`.

Then, since the two sides `DC`, `CE` are equal to the two sides `FA`, `AG` respectively, 

- and the base `DE` is equal to the base `FG`, the angle `DCE` is equal to the angle `FAG`. [1.8]

Therefore on the given straight line `AB`, and at the point `A` on it, the rectilineal angle `FAG` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal angle `DCE`.
