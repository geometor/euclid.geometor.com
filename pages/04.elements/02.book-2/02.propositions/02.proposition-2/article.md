If a straight line be cut at random, the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole.

===

For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at the point `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` together with the rectangle contained by `BA`, `AC` is equal to the square on `AB`. 

For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB` [<a href="/elem.1.46">I. 46</a>], and let `CF` be drawn through `C` parallel to either `AD` or `BE`. [<a href="/elem.1.31">I. 31</a>]

Then `AE` is equal to `AF`, `CE`.

Now `AE` is the square on `AB`;

`AF` is the rectangle contained by `BA`, `AC`, for it is contained by `DA`, `AC`, and `AD` is equal to `AB`; <span class="center">and `CE` is the rectangle `AB`, `BC`, for `BE` is equal to `AB`.</span>

Therefore the rectangle `BA`, `AC` together with the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `AB`.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
